"If you are bad just because you want to go to the bad place, would you still go? An answer to my sisters question.","My sister asked me this question today. She said that if you wanted to go to the good place, and you were good just because of that, then you would go to the bad place because your motivations were corrupted. So if you were bad on purpose, would you still go to the bad place? 

Most likely. 
Even if you don’t necessarily want to be mean, you still are hurting someone and not caring. For example, if you tell someone their acting is terrible, even if you don’t want to really hurt someone, you still are and won’t bother to care. 
A true good person would feel terrible about hurting someone, even if they want to go to the bad place.

And why would you even want to go to the bad place? You like being tortured? Weird flex but ok. However, since the bad place is modified based on the person, you won’t be tortured. So there really is no reason to go to the bad place.",TheGoodPlace,1556474813,AshKetchum1845,0,1,True,False,False,True,2019-04-28

&gt;And do you want to know what else I had a hunch about?

Shawn was right about Doug Forcett, even though he seemed to be speculating. Most likely he's just high enough into management to know that no one has made it to the Good Place in a while.

But this seems like he's about to talk about something that *had* occurred. And possibly even something that Michael also knew.

My thinking is that he was pretty sure Michael would be softened by spending time around the humans. Such concerns might have reached Michael through office gossip. (Though a less out there idea is that he just knew they were beyond version 2.)

Theory: Michael is Human,"In Seasons 1 and 2, we were told Michael was a bad place architect. However, he doesn’t make much sense as a Demon or even a Demon gone good.

For one, the only thing that makes Demons happy is torture. The only thing that makes Angels happy is being kind.
Michael enjoys torture, but not as much as the “other” demons. He seems to have more nuanced motivations, like we do.

In fact, Michael has a terrible sense of humor (and is insulted by Bad Place jokes and insults), unlike the other demons, and completely missed the point of Trevor’s Dick Tracy joke. In a sense, he had to be thought how to be bad by Eleanor.

Michael’s information about demons is inconsistent. He says he sees in 10 dimensions, when he only uses the three. He says his birthyear is “0000”, when he says that when he uses the term “millenial”, it means they’ve only tortured for 1000 years, which doesn’t make sense if they only exist to torture.

Michael said that the term “demon” was insulting and inaccurate - as it is to humans.

When Michael said the four humans were the first interdimensional fugitives, he might have been lying so the humans wouldn’t know he was human and the first interdimensional fugitive.

Or, he outsmarted or bribed one of the demons in his Bad Place neighborhood and managed to get free.

Either way, he tricked someone into giving him a job in torture, and climbed the ladder to architect. It’s likely Sean knows he’s human and pretends not to. It’s possible that retirement is impossible to do to humans, which is why Michael was not retired.

In fact, (other than the speculation on how he became an architect) this is only some of the evidence. When I was looking for quotes for this, I actually found a few subtle hints in favor of this theory.

Season 4 Theory based on Episode 17 of the podcast,"Episode 17 of the podcast features Lizzy Pace, who knew the plot of Season 4 at that point.  

Partway in they're talking about jokes that take a long time to pay off, and Lizzy mentions that there are things from the pilot that won't come into play until Season 4 (which is already really interesting).  

Then a few minutes later they're talking about canon jokes that got cut for time, and Lizzy points out a joke that got cut that was ""really important to the plot"". The joke was that Eleanor called Tahani a butthead to her face, and Tahani's head turned into a butt.  

My question is, why would that joke be ""really important""? What would it foreshadow? Could it mean that Eleanor has the power to change things or people in the afterlife somehow? And if so, what are some other instances where we might have seen her accidentally use this power?

Avengers: Endgame Solves The Trolley Problem (SPOILERS),"In the wake of Avengers: Infinity War, much has been written about the moral philosophy of its primary protagonist. (r/thanosdidnothingwrong)

&amp;#x200B;

In Thanos, the film gave us a complex and contemplative villain attempting to solve the trolley problem on a cosmic scale. In a universe hurtling towards certain extinction, he offers correction by trading lives for the continued survival of the spared. He sees the forest for the trees. He kills for the greater good, albeit his own twisted version of what that means. Thanos represents utilitarianism taken to its logical extreme. He sees no quandary in the trolley problem. He chooses to switch tracks every time. In the face of apocalyptic overpopulation, he proposes a grand and audacious culling and calls it salvation.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter The Avengers.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon realising that Wanda could singlehandedly prevent the impending onslaught by destroying the Mind Stone that resides in his forehead (and killing him by extension), Vision argues, “Thanos threatens half the universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.” Steve Rogers, a man with unquestioning morality, and perhaps the personification of Kantian deontology, retorts “but it should.” These diametrically opposed ideas form the push and pull that inform the entire film.

&amp;#x200B;

The juxtaposition of Thanos’ utilitarianism with the deontology of our heroes is exemplified by the doomed romances of both Gamora and Peter, and Vision and Wanda. It is by no mistake or convenience that the fate of these two relationships mirror each other, as it works in service to contrast the choices made by The Avengers with that of Thanos.

&amp;#x200B;

Peter and Wanda were forced into the unimaginable position of having to make a decision between switching tracks to kill the person they love most in order to save trillions, or doing nothing and watching Thanos wipe out half the universe. In avoiding killing their loved one and waiting too long, they wound up saving neither. Had Peter killed Gamora long before the Guardians confronted Thanos on Knowhere; had Wanda killed Vision before Thanos arrived in Wakanda, there would be no snap to speak of. Thanos, meanwhile, showed grief but no hesitation in switching tracks and choosing to sacrifice his daughter in order to obtain the soul stone and what in his mind would be saving trillions of lives.

&amp;#x200B;

This idea is echoed throughout the film. Characters were constantly forced into similar moral dilemmas and made choices that all but guaranteed the snap. Loki’s resistance to letting Thor die, hands Thanos the Space Stone. Gamora’s reluctance to see Nebula suffer, gives away the location of the Soul Stone. Dr Strange’s refusal to let Tony Stark die at the hands of Thanos, loses the Time Stone. In choosing not to switch tracks to end one life, they doomed half the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The film presents two paths — both equally unappealing. Killing one to save many undermines the value of life and leads you down the path of Thanos. Yet sparing one leads to the death of many just the same.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to Endgame.

&amp;#x200B;

As the film reaches its climax, Tony, knowing full well that using the gauntlet will kill him, seizes an opening. He swipes the Infinity Stones off of Thanos’ gauntlet, and transfers them onto his own. He snaps his fingers, dusting Thanos and his army; he makes the sacrifice play. In all 14, 000, 605 possible futures, the only scenario in which they prevail is predicated on one character solving the trolley problem.

&amp;#x200B;

In the immortal words of The Architect:

&gt;The trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die, and the actual solution is very simple — sacrifice yourself",TheGoodPlace,1557260266,xhteo,237,1257,True,False,False,True,2019-05-07
The ethics of torrenting books on ethics/philosophy,"I wanted to read up more on philosophy and ethics just to understand the basics, but I'm currently unemployed with a very tight budged so I just found some books on a torrenting site.

Is the gang still doomed?,"Back on Earth, once they learned about the point system, they couldn't get anymore points because their motivation was corrupt. But Eleanor suggested they try to help other people anyway, and a lot of the fandom believes that helping people despite knowing there's no reward in it for you is as pure a motivation as it's going to get.

&amp;#x200B;

And now there's this new experiment to see if human souls can still improve in the afterlife. The four new humans + Chidi are all ignorant of why they need to improve and so their betterment counts. But do the other three think that this new deal might still save them, and does this corrupt their motivation? Or is just having hope okay?

&amp;#x200B;

This question was brought to you by Chidi's 

""We'll just get through this, and you and I can chill out in the dot of the i forever."" 

cause it doesn't sound like he expects them all to go to hell at the end of the year. Not that it matters in his case, because he got mind-wiped.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think, even if the experiment is a success, Shawn could still say that 3/4 of Team Cockroach belong to the Bad Place because Michael corrupted their motivation, that everything they did was just out of self-preservation, yes even Eleanor's ""let's try anyway""; cue flashback of her pulling the same trick in *What's My Motivation* when she made those t-shirts and said ""Trust me. This'll work."" . And the gang couldn't argue his point, because it would only prove that they did believe that their work would save them in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

The Intended and Unintended Consequences of The Book of Dougs,"In *Janet(s)* (S3E10), we learn that no one has gotten into the Good Place in 521 years. We also learn that the values in the points system is determined by accountants who assign a point value to an action, and then anyone who performs that action in the future is given or loses that many points. The points system appears to be a form of [Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism) [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). 

From the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://www.iep.utm.edu/util-a-r/): ""Utilitarians believe that the purpose of morality is to make life better by increasing the amount of good things (such as pleasure and happiness) in the world and decreasing the amount of bad things (such as pain and unhappiness)...Act utilitarians believe that whenever we are deciding what to do, we should perform the action that will create the greatest net utility. In their view, the principle of utility—do whatever will produce the best overall results—should be applied on a case by case basis...Rule utilitarians adopt a two part view that stresses the importance of moral rules. According to rule utilitarians, a) a specific action is morally justified if it conforms to a justified moral rule; and b) a moral rule is justified if its inclusion into our moral code would create more utility than other possible rules (or no rule at all).""

I infer that the accountants assign a points value according to the value of the act, but then apply that value as a rule. The show doesn't provide any clarification on that matter that I can see, and it's possible that the accountants are predicting the value of that act into the future. If they're anticipating future value, it's odd that Og received 10,000 for giving a rock -- it seems like repeated gifts of a rock would thereafter get anyone in to the Good Place. 

I will digress for a moment to point out that the show has taken pains to establish that there is a huge exception to this Rule Utilitarian system. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism -- that is, the goodness of an action is determined by its positive consequences. Put another way, an act that maximizes positive consequences is a good act. In the Good Place, however, a positive action does not receive credit if the actor is certain that the Good Place exists. This exception is stated by Janet (and apparently acknowledged by Michael) in *Jeremy Bearimy* (S3E5) and referenced by the Judge in *Somewhere Else* (S2E12) when she says ""You're supposed to do good things because you're good, not because you're seeking moral dessert."" The fact that there's this exception to Rule Utilitarianism seems extremely inconsistent to me in a show that works so hard to explain and be consistent with difference ethical systems. It's a narrative crutch -- you have to present a reason why humans can't know that there's a Good Place, and the reason is ""because then they'll be good for the reward."" However, the entire basis for the universe's ethical judgment is otherwise not on intention, but consequences.

After visiting the accountants' office, Michael decides that the Bad Place must be hacking the points system, and goes to the Good Place to alert the Committee. In the next episode, *Book of Dougs* (S3E11), we finally get our first look into the actual Good Place, or at least its mail room. We meet the Committee, who are (appropriately for rule utilitarians) obsessed with obeying the proper rules and procedure. They totally qualify as [Lawful Stupid](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid) -- and there's even an entry for The Good Place on that page. Kellen is made to resign for failing to follow the procedure for a ""Hear! Hear!"". The Committee determines that they will establish a panel to investigate the points system, but it will take many, many, many years. Michael is upset about the length of time it will take -- the same Michael who in the last episode of season 2 (*Somewhere Else*) was willing to put the humans in their own medium places for up to a million years -- is now concerned about the human timescale. The odd thing about this to me is that on the Jeremy Bearimy timeline, the passage of time on Earth may or may not be relevant. 

Frustrated with the Committee, Michael takes another look at the Book of Dougs, and determines that the reason no one has reached the Good Place in 521 years is ""unintended consequences."" Apparently, due to the interconnectedness of the world for the past 521 years, no one can get enough points without receiving point deductions to make it to the Good Place. So, Mr. Rogers -- the Bad Place. Oskar Schindler -- the Bad Place. Small tribes or isolated groups -- doesn't matter, still the Bad Place. All babies and children who died of accident or illness -- the Bad Place. This is an extremely dark revelation for a show which is a comedy. The writers appear, from the show itself and the podcast, to consider the ramifications of what they reveal, and yet this is not addressed at all. There's a general outcry that more people should be reaching the Good Place, but Michael and the Soul Squad don't seem to care that people who are truly innocent are dying and condemned to an eternity of torture. The Judge doesn't care. The Lawful Stupid Committee doesn't care. Instead, this revelation is used to get the Judge to go to Earth and complain about Chik-Fil-A. And then, she decides that the world is complicated and maybe the system is wrong. 

As an aside, sometime during the Soul Squad's discovery of the system used to judge all humanity, it seems like Chidi, at least, should have realized that this is a Rule Utilitarianism run amok. Chidi mentions multiple times that he focuses on deontology and Kant. He appears to be some variety of Kantian ethicist. The revelation that the universe has One True Ethics (Rule Utilitarianism) and that his are wrong should have some sort of impact on him. It would be like a Christian reaching the afterlife and learning that Zoroastrianism was the correct faith. Chidi, who admittedly seems to be changed somewhat by his burgeoning relationship with Eleanor, doesn't even mention the fact that the system he studied his entire life and based his life on is Wrong with a capital W.

The ""unintended consequences"" revelation has almost ruined the show for me. It seems like pandering to the audience. It's consoling them that ""yes, life is hard in a way that it's never been hard before in history."" It's hazardous, at best, to make presumptions as to the direction the show will take, but Season 4 has been set up to show the Judge how humans could be Good when those unintended consequences are removed, and things like racism, sexism, prejudice, exploitation, etc. don't exist. If that's the case, the show is going to lose its relevance to ""real life"" because we live in that complicated, broken world, and I don't think anyone who's alive to watch the show is ever going to see anything different.

Unintended consequences are, nonetheless, concededly consistent with a Rule Utilitarian view. Intentions are irrelevant -- only results matter. The fact that you lose points for purchasing a tomato that was picked with exploited or enslaved laborers and transported 1000 miles (even if you're unaware of those facts) so that you could get it $.50 cheaper is in line with a utilitarian viewpoint. And then there's Mindy St. Claire -- the woman who, despite the fact that she only *intended* to open a charity with her life savings, nonetheless got credit for all the good it ultimately did. I have no idea how to explain that. 

The argument could be made that:
1. The Good Place is just a TV show.
2. The Rule of Funny and entertainment value trump deep logic and reason.
3. Explaining why dead kids go to hell doesn't have a place on a prime time family comedy series.
4. I should really just relax. 

I have no real refutation of that argument. In some sense, this is nitpicking a show that wants to entertain and raise ethical issues. It has been tremendously successful, in my opinion, at both. There is the danger, however, that people will take its arguments too far. I read several articles and comments around the time the Book of Dougs aired discussing how the episode captured our time or the current political environment. I think the episode only does that if you have a limited understanding of the ramifications and corollaries of the episode.

I will say I have hope for the future of the show. I think that ultimately the show will return to the idea that humans should be judged on their intentions. In *Best Self* (S2E9), Eleanor says to Michael, ""At least you tried to find a way to the Good Place, and that's the greatest thing someone can do."" On one of the podcast episodes, in response to Mark Evan Jackson's ""What is good?"", Mike Schur has said that trying to be good is good. My guess is that the show is actually against utilitarianism, and will result in a points system that gives credit to intentions. In the meantime, though, I found the end of the 3rd season to be very disappointing from a logical standpoint. Entertaining and funny without question, but it lost some of its status for me as a show that considers its own logic and continuity important. Now, somebody needs to nitpick me.",TheGoodPlace,1557350933,ohkwarig,7,12,True,False,False,True,2019-05-08

"The Ethics of the Existence of the Bad Place, and Predictions for the Future","So I think the primary reason we were able to accept the premise of a ""Good Place"" and a ""Bad Place"" back in Season 1 were that the idea of Heaven and Hell for good and bad people are culturally omnipresent, but also because we fundamentally believe in the maxim that ""bad people deserve to get punished."" That's why, I think, both the audience and the characters were relatively undisturbed by the fact that most of humanity was being tortured in the Bad Place. 

By the end of Season 1, though, we learn that all four of the main characters are in the Bad Place. While there is plenty of evidence that they are not saints, none of them seem to deserve eternal torture. AND THEN Season 3 came along, and revealed that everyone in the last five hundred years is being tortured, because apparently no one is good enough to get into the Good Place. So clearly something went wrong here. 

We generally accept that bad people deserve to be punished. But let's hold on for a moment and analyze the ethics of punishing bad people, and the reason for the Bad Place to exist. What if the very existence of a ""Bad Place"" was unethical?

&amp;#x200B;

First, from a consequentialist point of view: 

There are three primary reasons we as a society punish criminals: 

1. To separate them from regular citizens so they can't continue harming people. We isolate criminals in jails in part to put an end to their current crime sprees. A murderer can't kill any more innocent people if they're locked up in jail. 
2. To deter future crime. By punishing contemporary criminals, we tell potential criminals that there are consequences to crimes. Most potential criminals are then deterred from committing any crimes to begin with, creating a safer society. 
3. To reform the criminal so they can rejoin society. 

As aligning with the central tenet of consequentialism, all three reasons are for the sake of benefiting actual people. I would actually argue that, apart from the three listed above, there are no moral reasons to punish evildoers. Since punishing an evildoer brings more suffering into the world (the criminal's pain), the good of the punishment must outweigh the evil in order for the punishment to be just--it thus must accomplish at least some of the three reasons listed above. Simply punishing an evildoer for the sake of punishing an evildoer is not sufficient moral justification for harming another, even if it feels right. 

Now, the Bad Place exists solely to punish evildoers. So let's see how well it meets each of these goals: 

1. To separate them from regular citizens: the ""evildoers"" are already dead, so they'll be separated from the living no matter what's happening to them in the afterlife. 
2. To deter future crime: because no one in the living world is supposed to know how the system works, the Bad Place does absolutely nothing to deter future evildoing. 
3. To reform the criminal: the Bad Place simply does not do this. Up until Michael's experiment, humans in the Bad Place were simply physically and psychologically tortured; post-death moral improvement, in fact, was completely unprecedented. 

In other words, then, the existence of the Bad Place brings zero good into the world. Apart from torturing people for the sake of it, there seems to be no reason for the Bad Place to exist. Now, one might argue that there is some deeper cosmic reason for demons to torture humans--however, we've seen none of it. All I'm seeing, then, is that from a consequentialist point of view, the very existence of the Bad Place is unethical--because, until the Soul Squad came along, nothing good comes out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

From a deontologist point of view: 

I have to admit that I'm not very familiar with deontology, so I could be completely off-base here. But I think a deontologist would actually find the Bad Place system even more unethical than a consequentialist would. For a deontologist, ethics is governed by rules, or categorical imperatives: absolute requirements that must be obeyed in all circumstances and are ends in themselves. Furthermore, deontologists must act as if their every moral decision were to enter a ""kingdom of ends"" and become a moral law. So a deontologist would naturally object to the torture of human beings--if one demon tortures a dickwad, the demon essentially says that torture is permissible in any situation. If torture is wrong, it is always wrong, even if it's in the universe-sanctioned Bad Place. 

Now let's go back to the three reasons for punishment listed above. A deontologist would probably only absolutely agree with the third reason as a valid reason to punish somebody. Another important tenet in deontology is that it is wrong to use people as a means for something: because all humans are rational beings, they must be treated as ends themselves. In other words, you cannot use someone as a pawn to accomplish a goal; their wellbeing should be your goal instead. Punishing criminals to deter future crime, by deontological standards, is then unethical, because you would be using the criminal as a mean to your goal. One could also argue that isolating criminals for the sake of regular citizens is also unethical, because you're still using the criminal for the sake of the citizens instead of respecting their existence as a rational agent. 

The only ethical reason to punish a evildoer, then, is the third: to reform them so they can rejoin society. This is the only reasoning behind punishment where the criminal is treated as an end instead of a means. 

&amp;#x200B;

And this reformative punishment idea is actually where I think the show is headed. Two major themes in The Good Place are redemption and the fundamental goodness of humanity. While Eleanor is a scumbag early in Season 1, the rest of the season goes to show that, with friendship and community, Eleanor is capable of becoming a better person. The same pattern is repeated with the other characters: Chidi becomes more decisive (near the end of Season 3), Tahani reconciles with her sister, and Michael goes from ruthlessly torturing the Soul Squad to joining them in sympathy and goodness. Almost every human (and one demon) is shown to be capable of redemption. Season 4, meanwhile, is poised to start with a new neighborhood experiment with four new characters. The cast and the Judge will see if they can get these four humans to improve as well, essentially testing the human goodness the show has previously emphasized. 

So here is my prediction for the future direction of the show: whether the experiment succeeds or not, eventually the Judge (or whoever else is in charge) will realize that humans can change for the better. Given the show's positive view of deontology, the main characters will probably then convince the Judge that punishment's true purpose should not be mere suffering, but the reformation of the evildoer. Somehow, the afterlife system will be overhauled to replace the traditional Bad Place torture with more of Michael's neighborhoods--positive, nurturing environments where people can improve themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[an interesting sidenote: Kant's Formula of Autonomy says that people have to obey the categorical imperative because they are rational agents. Since Michael, a perfectly average demon, was able to reform into a good person, it seems that the demons are also rational agents, just like humans. So why aren't the demons subject to the categorical imperative? Why aren't the demons also obligated to do good things like humans are? One could argue that it is their nature to be evil, but Michael's character development shows that they clearly have free will. Wonder how that's going to play out in the future.\]",TheGoodPlace,1557472426,sam-jam-hands,4,14,True,False,False,True,2019-05-10

Watched all 3 seasons in 7 days. Holy shirtballs this show is forking brilliant.,"\*Spoiler warning, I'm just going to go on a ramble about how much I love this show here, but I'm likely going to mention specifics at some point, so be aware!\*

As per the title, I only started watching this show last Sunday with the intention of enjoying it over a longer period, but once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I have watched the entirety of S3 today!

This has quickly become one of my favourite shows. It's so charming, and hilarious, and... well it's just great.

I love the constant references to incidents or moments from previous episodes or seasons without them butchering the script by explaining why what they are saying is a callback like some shows might do. It just trusts us to get the references. 

It's also a rare show in that there isn't one character I don't enjoy. Chidi and Janet are my favourites but everyone is great. I love the way Janet has involved and she's just so funny, and Chidi is just adorable. Cracks me up whenever he delivers a surprised 'WHAT!?'. Jason is such a moron but it's impossible not to warm to him, Tahani is a bragger but just lovely and Michael is brilliant too. And, of course Eleanor who is just a legit snack and I've really enjoyed seeing her journey of becoming a better person. Even all the recurring characters like Trevor, The Judge, Shawn, Derek and Todd the... lava guy? are all just on point, too.

Genuinely not one thing about this show that I dislike.

Well other than the fact they keep getting reset and the end of S3 was a heartbreaker with Chidi having to have his memory wiped.

That also brings me to another thing I admire about this show. They could so easily do the old trope of characters remembering each other even though they have had their memories wiped because their bond is so strong from sharing at least 800 versions of life/death/whatever that they 'just remember', but so far they haven't done that. 

Perhaps the weakest part of the show, and I say that in a way of not even disliking it, just perhaps if you're determined to find fault, is that maybe the way Chidi and Eleanor got together in S3 perhaps felt a slight bit forced in that it seemed to come from nowhere from Chidi's side.

Also, I find it really sad that they keep getting their memories wiped. To die and find each other in the afterlife is nice even though it turns out they are in the bad place. But then, at the end of S1 they get reset, so it's almost like we might as well disregard S1 as S2 starts with them really being who they were right at the start of S1. And then when they get sent back to Earth it's like great they are alive again, but yet again that's just sad because now everything they shared before in the afterlife means nothing to who they now are again. But like I say, that's not a dislike as such, and it speaks volumes to how great this show is that that all still feels fine, somehow.

Anyway, can't wait for S4. It should be cool, dope, fresh and smart brained.",TheGoodPlace,1557603273,Funkosebsy,7,64,True,False,False,True,2019-05-11

Discussion- Ethical Complications in the Modern Society [Spoilers?],"Season 4 hasn't come out yet so I'm not certain this is the outcome that will prevail but judging by the current trajectory and the fact that the show is first and foremost a comedy and not a commentary I'd assume Team Cockroach will be proven right and the humans will end up in the good place and be declared good humans, but here's why I think that's not how entirely justified. The show argues that due to the unknown consequences of actions in our society, being a good person has become difficult and that people are on average actually better than they are credited for by the point system. 

Although I agree with this premise, the underlying issue with this shift of standards appealed for by Micheal implies the allowing of the bad practices of corporations and individuals in our world. To elaborate- think about the current state of the earth and how humans are affecting climate change and mass extinction. If we give in to the argument that the blame falls solely on the producers and individuals are helpless in this situation, we are taking away an important factor from the equation. If a man obtains negative points for an action such as offering his grandma a rose because of his contribution to the mistreatment of migrant workers it follows logically that he has caused a negative impact to the world despite his well-intentioned actions. Should the negative outcome he has supported be dismissed as ignorance or should he be held accountable for this action? Obviously, that is a difficult answer to formulate and I acknowledge Chidi's point in that analysing each of your choices might be impractical but that still doesnt excuse the fact that the world is in peril and it is no one's but our own collective fault. 

(The following paragraph is completely just me completely flexing my ethical superiority and I can remove it but I decided to leave it to prevent personal attacks and also invite suggestions, so you can choose to skip it)
Speaking from personal experience this show has made me reconsider a lot of things I took for granted and this revelation in conjunction to the beginning of my adult life apart from my parents has allowed me to make changes I think are reducing my negative impact in the world. For example, I follow a vegan lifestyle, try my best to shop local/from farmers markets, offset my carbon footprint by having an organisation plant trees on my behalf, and tend to at least skim through the practices of the brands I support. But I am certain that I am inadvertently causing some evil to be put out in this world. I am certainly not a humanitarian and I don't have the resources to bring actual good into this world yet but I am still trying to limit my negative actions until I can create positive impact on the world.

In my opinion, the main motivation behind the actions that might be considered unethical is probably entirely based on economics. The migrant worker working at a blueberry facility is only hired so that they may be underpayed and overworked, so that the price of the end product (blueberries) remains competitive in the market. We all know the products at Farmer's markets are expensive so these low prices and the scarcity in our pockets make us support these large money hungry corporations that help us save money even though they might be taking unethical approaches to achieve said competitive prices. So then why would it be incorrect to recognise this as a choice that the consumer has made? If we strive towards total moral cleanliness how can we absolve the unforeseen negative consequences of our actions? Very seldom is it arguable that the product has no practical alternatives which then needs to be considered on a case by case basis but otherwise in most circumstances the consumers have a choice and more often than not we are motivated by price because that is all the information that is available to us and in this society this might unintentionally create negative consequences but we cannot simply deny responsibilty for these on the basis of ignorance and lack of transparency.

We are all bad people! Just because everyone around us is hurting the world by polluting the environment and supporting mistreatment of people doesn't excuse us to do the same, it does not normalise the action because in absolute terms we are still doing bad things. I recognise the privillege in that not everyone has the option to pay the extra whatever premium to get better more ethically sourced food and other necessities, but if the average person decided to sacrifice a little bit of whatever can be sacrificed, they should make the effort to curb these corporations because like it or not, the reason these inhumane practices exist is because of us, falling for the mask these corporations throw over our eyes, keeping the consumer in the dark about their practices and make their sale solely through their low prices. We as consumers need to be more aware of the manufacturing of the products we support and keep ourselves educated in that matter. 

The practicality of living like Chidi might be debatable but we need to set our intentions into motion, by limiting our involvement in bad farming practices, unnecessary fossil fuel usage and take the necessary first step to becomng a sustainable society, while contintuing to invite regulations for corporations that will allow making this choice easier (from requiring free range egg cartons to state how free their chickens really are to pushing for cleaner energy even if it is not the economical choice right now). We NEED to push for improvments in the transparency of our producers to help us make the choice on metrics other than price. But until that is the norm we still need to- as much as possible- educate ourselves about the implications of our actions as individuals and give these corporation a reason to be transparent- to buy OUR consumption, to force them to sell their products to us through something not as cut and dry as pricing. 
There is no way to simplify the complications of our choices that we make in this world that we have created for ourselves but we cannot simply ignore the complications and pretend it is simplified.",TheGoodPlace,1558081350,rnohit,0,3,True,False,False,True,2019-05-17

He’s also hunted by an immortal cowboy who’s unkillable and can down entire armies so it’s an interesting story.

The show is honestly amazing, its hilarious although really witty and sarcastic in its delivery. Its more dark and bloody than the Good Place with a lot more action than philosophical lectures, but I highly recommend it if you’re into afterlife shenanigans &amp; the meaning of life.",TheGoodPlace,1558374823,MyMomBeatsMe01,2,6,True,False,False,True,2019-05-20

Why Michael's Gambit Couldn't Work,"Michael's plan was doomed from the start, and it's all due to the Prisoner's Dilemma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma?wprov=sfla1).

The humans in the neighborhood are imprisoned insofar as they cannot get out and are forced to interact with a finite set of people everyday. It's hard to understand how everybody wouldn't get on everybody else's nerves after a few thousand years. Anyway, in this closed system, Michael has the humans behave in their usual (i.e. selfish, self-centered) ways, just like they did on Earth in an open system, where their selfishness was lost in the mass and offset by the general process of society. This is their rational behavior, and it should have been so in the neighborhood too; for instance, Chidi should rationally have given Eleanor in, to preserve his self-interest and avoid any stomachaches.

This situation is analogous to the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two prisoners are given a choice to either cooperate with their accomplice, or rationally betray them to preserve themselves.

But then, something happens in the neighborhood: the humans cooperate. When the Prisoner's Dilemma was tested, a bias towards cooperation was discovered.

""It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other. The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better individual reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a systemic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of ""rational"" self-interested action.""

So our beloved Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani and Jason couldn't help but cooperate. Michael's mistake was relying too much on human selfishness and rationality, when human relationships depend on a large part on emotions. And humans are social animals: our morality is mostly based on the fact that we feel emotions &lt;i&gt;for each other&lt;\i&gt;.",TheGoodPlace,1558750592,sacha8uk,5,44,True,False,False,True,2019-05-24

This might sound weird but... Is anyone else here who stumbled upon TGP in a time in their life when they needed it? Basically... like a sign from the universe?,"Hey guys
I know, this is very ""Baader-Meinhof phenomenon"" to talk about the meaning of life and parallel dimensions and hidden messages in a subreddit of a show, that deals with basically the same motives... But I am just curious, if anyone of you guys had the feeling, that this is a weird concidence, that they stumbled upon this show?

For proper context: I live in Germany and I am not a native speaker. I'm 31 and I've never been a esoteric kind of guy, quite the opposite actually. I did experience a few very weird coincidences and had a bunch of interesting talks with different people in the last couple of weeks that made me rethink my former pure ""materialistic"" and scientific aproach to viewing the world, changing to ""there are probably be things and forces we don't understand""

and then my girlfriend introduced me to this show (which she found by accident a couple of weeks before). Since the show came out almost three years ago and is only availeable in Germany on a quite obscure streaming platform ""maxdome"" (think Netflix, but way smaller and mostly really shitty shows and movies) it kinda feels like a sign that i watched it now.

"Originally, about 10% of humans went to the bad place.","I was on a rewatch and decided to run some numbers when I heard (I think) Glen say they were torturing around 30 billion humans. We also know no human has made it to the good place in about 500 years. 

General estimates are that [about 108 billion people have existed](https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/). Of those, about 22 billion are from 1650 onward. I don't have any direct estimates of 1520, so let's just go with 1650 numbers. 

There are about 7.7 billion people alive right now, so about 100.3 billion people have died and been sorted. Of those, 22 billion certainly went to the bad place as they were born after the moment when everyone started going to the bad place. That leaves 78.3 billion people sorted prior to 1650. If 30 billion are being tortured and 22 are recent, then a mere 8 billion humans were sent to the bad place prior to 1650/1500. 

8 billion people out of 78.3 billion is about 10.2%. All numbers are obviously fuzzy since I'm working with 1650 numbers and those numbers are estimates since there was no census anyway... But that's my estimate. Prior to the negative consequences of global connectedness, about 90% of humans made it to the good place.",TheGoodPlace,1558973921,Series_of_Accidents,21,222,True,False,False,True,2019-05-27

The ethical implications of Eleanor having a relationship with Chidi [SPOILERS],"I finally finished Season 3, and I loved it. The finale was so emotional and ambitious, and it really cemented my love for this show. 

However, as much as this show has inspired me to study philosophy and ethnics, I am still very much a newby in this regard. I understand that Chidi's memory must be erased, and Eleanor's will not. Does this create any ethical quarries they must navigate moving forward? It seems that both of them (understandably) want to be together again. However, we are now dealing with no only an imbalance of power, as she will be in a sort of authority position over him (her words were a sexy god-like figure), but also an imbalance of knowledge. She will know him intimately, his desires, his hang-ups, how to help him, what makes him tick, etc, and it will be really hard for someone devastated by the love of their life not remembering them to not use that information even subconsciously to get closer to him. She'll be drawn to him and have a wealth of information about him that we won't even realize she has. Also, given that she can't disclose it to him, any relationship they develop will be built on or around deception.  I don't envy the position she is in.

In short, I totally ship these two characters, and that montage of their time together was soul crushing in a beautiful way. But wouldn't any relationship they have in the future be riddled with ethical concerns?",TheGoodPlace,1559221805,dance_apoptosistic,3,13,True,False,False,True,2019-05-30

I'd expect him to have a stronger accent. Is Chidi even from Senegal? Is the good place translator filtering out Chidi's accent so Eleanor can understand him? Or is there something darker at play like there's someone on the inside trying to warn Elanor about Michel's gambit through subtle suggestion?
My third ""theory"" to use the term loosely is based on the nature of the good place. In an infinite universe with an un-determined number of planets, doesn't it seem a little weird that there is an afterlife would exist solely for humans? Surely other species, whether terrestrial, extra-terrestrial or even extra-solar can be able to do enough good or bad or order to be admitted to the good or bad place. I'm no architect, but to exclude every being in the universe bar humans seems a little in-efficient.",TheGoodPlace,1559642606,Gregory_Andounuts,5,0,True,False,False,True,2019-06-04

"Since the show is ending, I wanted to share this story","I never really had a time to talk about this on the subreddit, but now seems like a good time!

Back in May 2016, I went on one of the tram tours at Universal Studios. When we got to the what I think was called ‘Little Italy’, we had to stop since they were filming something. Our tour guide told us they couldn’t tell us it what it was, but it would be premiering later that fall.

We waited for about ten minutes near a trailer thing, I think it was a bathroom. Several people went in and out and back to the set, one of them wearing a monk outfit and another woman, but none of them were people I recognized.

Later that night I went to go look up shows that were going to air in the fall, and I discovered The Good Place. It made even more sense because on the tour, we passed by a parking space labeled ‘K. Bell’ who could only be Kristen Bell.

So knowing that I saw them filming the show led to me checking it out later that year. I also realized the two people I saw going to the bathroom were Jason and Tahani!

It’s awesome to look back on it now, but I didn’t take any pictures thinking I wasn’t allowed to. So glad to have witnessed the making of such a fun show!",TheGoodPlace,1559963102,kodiakchrome,0,67,True,False,False,True,2019-06-07

Spinoff idea,"Ok, now that The Good Place is coming to an end this season, I fee like the logical next step is spin offs within the main story arc.  My proposal would be to launch multiple “experiments” a la Season 4 but where Sean has drafted characters from other Mike Schur shows. The Good Place Characters have to teach them how to be better.  So, draft 1 from each show (B99, Office, Parks and Rec) and I guess round it out with a new fourth character.  Groups I would like to see:

Neighborhood 1
1.  Kevin (Office)
2.  Tom Haverford (Parks)
3.  Kevin (B99) - Bonus is MEJ plays the role which drives TGP characters nuts (Can see Ellinor saying “you know who you look just like...”)

Neighborhood 2
1.  Ron Swanson (Parks)
2.  Darrell (Office)
3.  Gina Linetti (B99)

Neighborhood 3
1.  Dwight Schrute (Office)
2.  Rosa Diaz (B99)
3.  April Ludgate (Parks)
They are kind of similar characters but they would drive each other nuts.

Neighborhood 4:
1.  Angela (Office)
2. Donna Meagle (Parks)
3.  Charles Boyle (B99)

"With all the talk of ending, what are your hopes for season four?","* I hope to see more of the Judge, Mindy, Bad Janet, and Derek (who was absent from the s3 finale for some reason!)
* Since each season begins with an episode titled ""Everything is \_\_\_\_"" I think the perfect title for the series finale would be ""Everything is Good"" 
* I hope they don't get too wrapped up in the romance storylines. With Derek-Janet-Jason and especially Simone-Eleanor-Chidi, I hope they focus more on the characters and not the relationships (please no cheesy love triangle!)
* I think it should end with a 'snap' by Michael or the Judge (or God??) and the screen goes black right after that
* Looking forward to some more great restaurant name puns
* I actually don't want to see ""The Good Place"". I think it would be better left as a mystery. A good way to do this would be the opposite of the season one theme: Instead of learning that *""*Hell is Other People,"" they should find that ""Heaven is Other People,"" and that as long as they have each other, they don't need a good place

Why Jason's grading system makes perfect sense,"Jason told Tahani that he grades things on a scale of 1 to 13 with 8 being the highest. I assume that it is just a straight tent and 1 and 13 would be on the same level. But since there are 8 numbers on the left side and 6 on the right the numbers going from 8 to 13 would be 4/3 of the numbers going from 1 to 8.

[SPOILERS] Theory of How it Actually Might End - All Seasons,"SPOILERS I just had a weird moment of either 1.) clarity or 2.) stupidity. Sorry for the format, I’m on mobile.

So, this is a theory of how it may actually end/what the final twist could be! Thinking broadly, and just watching a bunch of old episodes, and this thought occurred to me (apologize if others have written this before...):

What if the reason The Good Place seems oddly behind the times, no one was watching the Janet warehouse, the council is so bogged down in slowness/politics/slow thinking is because for whatever reason, there ARE NO EMPLOYEES LEFT in The Good Place.  No one has  gotten in because, for whatever reason, there is a skeleton crew running the entire good place...and, because of this? They needed to start recruiting Good Place managers/bosses. They’ve always been in the Good Place, but they needed to pass a blind recruitment test. So a plan WAS created, but not what we (and the 4) have been led to believe was the plan.... 

Because, then, in order for them to be approved to be the Good Place architects and “management”, they needed to make sure that they had the absolute perfect souls to handle not only the Good Place’s old backlog of souls, but also the new souls. They needed four people/souls like this - a new kind of architect maybe - these 4 souls that would understand —with much more clarity— how to design neighborhoods and make the “good place calls” for who gets in that is dying now on this current Earth. The only way to do that? The only way to make sure these 4 are the right people, because this may be the first time souls that lived on Earth are ever asked to be architects... would be to make them design THEIR version of the Good Place while being blind to the truth. They would then (I assume this will happen in the next season) have a final test which is: can these souls see through the fact that they once knew these new recruits picked as the worst for “them” (the 4) and still make the correct decision as to whether the souls belong in the Good or Bad Place.

This would mean that Janet and Michael are really angels, or Michael is, and they’ve always been in the Good Place. They (the judge, Michael, Janet, etc) already know the final test is the souls brought in which the main 4 think are there because they are the “best to torture” our heroes.... are already souls that belong in the Good Place. If they complete these tests correctly. The series ends with these four heroes being the new leaders and runners and architects of The Good Place and they get to run it for eternity w Michael, etc. Happy and twisted ending! 

The secondary version of my theory here is that the 4 could all have always worked for the Good Place, but agreed to have their memories erased - LIKE CHIDI DID IN THE S3 FINALE - because they knew (Like Chidi did sort of) that the only way to be unbiased from DAY ONE was to erase their memories... 

This could explain a lot (Janet always “evolving” when maybe it’s just she needs excuses because she, in our hero 4’s eyes, has to have reasons to explain her emotions, etc, why Eleanor kept figuring it out over and over - and Jason even once - it’s her angel or good soul pushing through, and why the Good Place seems so behind in the times, etc)

I know there are potentially holes you brilliant people here will find, but this theory seems plausible and I would love to hear what you all think if you agree - what other puzzle piece or pieces could fit here to prove this is a viable theory as to how it may end? I could be 100% wrong, I also am thinking of ten other things this would explain, but I won’t make this insanely long because most here already know what I mean.  Something tells me this would be a possible direction, at least, for the series to go and ultimately end with.... or, it’s the same, but VERY dark, and the Bad Place and Michael really just wanted the people going to the bad place to design or walk right into designing the BEST own personal hell for themselves in the Bad Place.

But I can't shake the feeling that the announcement was an elaborate fake-out by Michael Schur &amp; co. All I can figure is that our sincere belief that the story is coming to the end is necessary to sell the stakes of the season before a MASSIVE reversal in the narrative.

Part of the reason I have this feeling is I SWEAR I read something about a six season plan after the first season had aired. Part of the reason I believe it is denial. And part of the reason I believe it is that THE GOOD PLACE is literally the only show on television that could pull something like that off.

[Spoilers] Theory of the meaning and result of it all: The good place,"So like I said in a previous post I had made I had been re-watching the series with the wife. We have made it through season 2 and I began contemplating the direction the show is trying to go and the overall message they may be trying to send/convey. I had considered many different ideas such as the few mentioned on this and other subs but I've come to my conclusions and want to see what you guys think of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why hasn't anyone gotten into the good place in over 500 years?

A: The Printing press

In more broad strokes, the acceleration of technology. It past times before the printing press people couldn't hear the word of god prior except at church. Religion held the religious text's and getting copies was incredibly difficult. Not just because of the church's grasp on them but also getting one made was incredibly difficult. After the invention of the printing press the word was now available to anyone who wanted it. But that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. After all isn't more readily available knowledge a good thing? Yes but then no. What the printing press, and subsequently the acceleration of technology, caused us to do is not have to meet to hear the word or otherwise converse. We were no longer around each other AS much and thus the need to improve each other was lessened.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of season 2 Eleanor watches a lecture done by Chidi titled ""What do we owe each other?"". In it Chidi postulates the innate desire to be good does not come from a potential reward, because we have no confirmation of a reward. Instead it comes from our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat other with dignity. 

&amp;#x200B;

However that has diminished. Bonds between people have lessened. As people have become more connected their bonds that truly connected them have weakened. South park explores this in their episode about friends on facebook. How many friends in your facebook feed truly are your friends? Is there a deep bond that forces you to treat them good and with dignity?

&amp;#x200B;

The invention of the printing press both made people more connected intellectually but less connected personally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What is the series pushing towards as their big reveal?

A: The maybe the reason the 4 have improved is because they have connected in a more personal form.

The biggest trait all four share with each other is that in their real life there was no bond between them and others. Eleanor purposefully shrank from creating bonds, Chidi shut himself off from the world severing bonds, Tahani create superficial bonds in the search for her parents approval, and Jason bonded with people who felt no obligation back. They all failed to create true personal connections that would push them to be good in a genuine way. The reason Doug Forcett is not making it too the good place is because he is following the letter of the law but shutting himself off from the world and not creating the personal connections which drive a natural desire to be good. He is treating it like a video game high score.

&amp;#x200B;

People as a whole slowly lost this personal bond over the years due to the advancement of technology. The world grew but the circle of people in which you created long bonds with grew smaller and smaller. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this will be the result of the the series examination. All the question will be posed that can these types of personal bonds be achievable in today's technologically advanced society. I also believe the answer is yes and for the reason people have failed to get into the good place. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: How will they fix the point system?

A: By using it against itself.

We learned in season 3 that the point system is flawed because even a small purchase can result in misery for countless people. It is a cascade that seems impossible to overcome. However there is a side to that they have not explored. When you perform a general good there is a cascading effect that can result from that as well. If I shop at a Walmart yes the things I buy may cause countless people misery. However if I donate money to a charity then the multiple people that it may overall affect should could into the point total as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The old system is grading people base on this old system of personal bonds and individual actions and results. However the new world requires a new system. The American Cancer Society has helped over 11 million people enjoy life past the disease. If I raised 400 dollars for them then I have in some small way contributed to that 11 million people. It may not be directly but I have done it indirectly in the same way purchasing a t-shirt from target has contributed to the misery of others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Q: So what is the message?

A: Humanity as a whole has become much more good, but not in a well rounded way.

We as a species have become better. It may not feel like it at times the reality is we have. We no longer think of the personal bonds. We think of our species as a whole. How is my life impacting the world? What am I doing to make the world I live in a better place? There will always people who don't think this way but the majority do. But because of how easily connected we are to all the bad it's harder to see. It's hard to see how $1 towards children's miracle network does any good but we see the problems that are created by supporting irresponsible companies. Back before the printing press this was not easily seen. We are much more aware of our presence now more than ever but we certainly haven't gotten worse for it.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have failed to do is impact the world we live in on a much more personal scale because of thinking on a much larger scale. Much like Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason we haven't looked at the world in front of us. Eleanor takes a step in that direction after her near death experience. Jason Forcett does look at the world in front of him but doesn't consider the big picture.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to do both to truly become a better person. We need to think of how we affect the world around us on a large scale but remember that the small contributions to big problems have helped. However we also need to consider the every day things which we encounter. The person stranded on the side of the road. The person in line short on money. These personal bonds are what pushes us to be better in the end because they feel more impactful. They immediately show us that our good deeds have immediate rewards and that more longer last good deeds can have longer lasting rewards.

Season 3 Theory,"After watching every episode about eight times but, like, twenty different sessions, I think I've come up with a solid enough theory for what Team Cockroach might be up to inside the simulation: 

They're going to change the world. 

We all know how much the show loves foreshadowing things and tying them up later on, and I can see Eleanor becoming Chidi's pupil ""IRL"" this time around and, while she learns a shirt-ton about ethics 'cause she studied, she'll eventually have and epiphany much like Mindy St. Claire, and he'll help her become what she once pretended to be: an environmental activist who did extraordinary work to raise awareness (not just because she loves mushrooms). 

And one of the main reasons they'll be able to actually change the world is because a certain British philanthropist with legs for days will help raising funds for their missions, getting Tahani into the mix and allowing her to dedicate her life to a worthy cause with the right motivation by ditching her need to overshadow Kamilah (hopefully without losing her knack for name-dropping because that's just too funny). 

I'm unclear how Jason might end up involved in their antics, but I can see him in an inspirational role helping the Team on the ground to fulfill their goals and bring more people to the cause, since he does have an almost preternatural way of solving problems, even if right now his solutions mostly involve Molotov cocktails *(BOOORTLEEEESSSSS!).*

And then, after they've changed the world and proved that bad people can become good if they get a little push in the right direction, they gain admittance into the Good Place and their real challenge as a Team begins: changing the Afterlife. 

I can see season 3 being split in half with these two main storytelling pods, and then an announcement that this was the final season all along, because I really don't think they'd want to extend the show forever and would rather go out on a high note with a proper ending. 

This might end up as just baseless speculation but, Mikeyyy, if you're reading this and I got anything right, hire me, bud!

Just Had A Season 3 Thought (Spoilers up to S3),"We know that The Neighborhood started for everyone on the same day. But it's not likely that all four of them died on the same day, is it?

Option One: If all four 'died' on the same day, then it means they all have a life changing near death experience, literally at the same time, which motivated them to make changes. That alone is enough to get them all in a room.

Example:

***

""Hello, I'm Tahani. My Friend Nicole and my other friend Hugh tell me Australia is a nice place to live. I just need to know... What do you think of my sister Kamilah?""

""I don't know who that is, you sexy giraffe.""

""I've found a homeland at last! So, what shall we do today? Ethics lessons? My friend Madonna tells me that my dear Fraternity Sister Miley is trying to get into a class like this...""

***

Option Two: If they all died at different times, then Eleanor has lived one year longer than she was meant to, but she might be the first one. She's found Chidi now. if she sticks with him like she should, then it means she's there:

***

""Hey! Dork! When your friend tells you that you're not his Best Man anymore, and then invites you for a round of drinks, the correct answer is: Wherever's closest, and then you order the most expensive thing on the menu, since he's buyi-LOOK OUT!""

""Ohh, that was close. I feel like I should have a stomach-ache.""

""That old guy just saved your life... And he looks familiar!""

***

I can see this being a major plot point.

What moral Philosophy does the Universe Subscribe to? (Response) (spoilers [obviously]),"The Good Philosophy
An Existential Reading and Analysis of NBC’s The Good Place

By: u/freakingbullshirt


NBC’s The Good Place is a television show about where we go when we die. While Friedrich Nietzsche would probably laugh at the idea and say that heaven is a condition of the heart, not somewhere you go after death, he would also probably say, “What’s a television show?” 

By following four characters’ journey through the afterlife, The Good Place becomes an existentialist’s guide to navigating modern society and life in general by showing us how we shouldn’t live our lives. Before we dive into the philosophy of the show, let’s recap what happened in season one. 

The Good Place opens on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) waking up and being told by Michael (Ted Danson) that she has died and is now in the “Good Place.” The Good Place is not the Christian heaven or hell, it is instead one of many distinct Good Place neighborhoods where only the best humans live when they die. Michael, the architect of the neighborhood, tells Eleanor that she is in the Good Place because of her exemplary life on Earth. There’s just one problem: Eleanor isn’t supposed to be there. Eleanor was not a human rights lawyer that spent her free time feeding hungry children as Michael said she was. Instead Eleanor worked at a call center in Arizona and scammed old people into buying medication they didn’t need. Season one of The Good Place follows Eleanor as her soulmate Chidi (everyone is assigned a soulmate upon entering the Good Place; Eleanor’s soulmate just happens to be a professor of ethics from Senegal) teaches her how to be a better person so she can learn to live in the Good Place. Chidi secretly teaches the basics of moral philosophy to Eleanor and Jason (an amateur DJ from Jacksonville, Florida who was also mistakenly taken to the Good Place) until they are caught by Tahani, Jason’s soulmate. Everything comes to a head in the final episode of the season when agents from the Bad Place come to collect two people in order to compensate for mistakenly sending Eleanor and Jason to the Good Place. As all of our main characters are fighting about who deserves eternal damnation, Eleanor has an epiphany. She turns to Michael and says, “As we were all fighting and yelling at each other about who deserves to go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself ‘Man, this is torture.’ And then it hit me. They’re never going to call a train to take us to the Bad Place. They can’t, because we’re already here. This is the Bad Place.” 

It’s hard to understate the impact of Eleanor’s realization. The entire show is flipped on its head in the last few minutes of the season when Michael reveals that he is, in fact, a demon who designed the “Good Place” just to torture Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani. Not only does this turn of events raise thousands of questions about the plot of the show, it also firmly cements The Good Place as a true existential work, but we’ll get to that.
Before we can discuss what the philosophy espoused by The Good Place can teach us, we must first establish that it the show operates under existential theory, not utilitarianism or contractualism as some on the internet have theorized. In episode one, during Eleanor’s orientation into the Good Place, Michael shows her a video that explains how people are sorted between the Good Place and the Bad Place. In this video, Michael states that “During your time on Earth, every one of your actions carried with it a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe. When your time on Earth ends, we calculate the total value of your life… only people with the very highest scores come here, to the Good Place!” With this points system, The Good Place seems to posit a belief in moral objectivism. Furthermore, if every action here on Earth carries with it a positive or negative point value, doesn’t that fly in the face of existence preceding essence? However, the key to understanding The Good Place as an existential work is to realize that this points system is not what actually determines whether a person belongs in the Good Place or the Bad Place.

Chidi dedicated his life to moral philosophy and to living ethically and is shown to have 1,948,668 points. Tahani raised billions of dollars for countless charities and accrued 997,485 points throughout her life. However consider for a moment that we know all of our four characters are all actually in the Bad Place, despite how many points they have. This puts to bed any possibility that the show might operate under contractualism or utilitarianism, as both operate under the assumption that objective moral truth not only exists but that it would be the basis on which you would judge whether someone is good or bad.

So if total points don’t determine whether a person is good or bad- what does? Although The Good Place answers this question differently for each character, it seems that each character is sent to the Bad Place for violating a concept that existentialist philosophers warned us about. Let’s begin with Jason.

**Jason Mendoza** spent his life as an amateur DJ in Jacksonville, Florida. Making ends meet by selling fake drugs to college kids, Jason died by suffocation when he hid inside a safe during a botched robbery of a Mexican restaurant. While he might not have spent his life helping orphans or working for the greater good, why does he deserve to be in the bad place? Jason’s only goal in life was to become a successful DJ. In his own words, “I don’t want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever. I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa even. I want it all.” When he was finally given the opportunity to take over for the popular DJ AcidCat, the crowd ended up booing him off stage. Jean-Paul Sartre would agree that Jason belongs in the Bad Place because Jason lived as a Being-for-Others. Sartre cautioned that in many relationships, people can fall in love not with each other, but with the feeling they get when the other person looks at them. In doing so, the lovers become trapped as the for-itself is replaced with the other person’s thoughts and actions. Neither person’s purpose is to exist as an individual. Jason’s obsession with becoming a DJ is no different. His for-itself had been replaced by the success of his career. His career abruptly ended when he was booed off stage at the AcidCat show. Instead of moving on with his life, Jason was left with no sense of self and spiraled out of control, he ended up torching AcidCat’s speedboat and eventually died while trying to rob a Mexican restaurant a day later. If The Good Place’s moral philosophy is determined by existential theory as I have stated, Sartre says Jason belongs in the Bad Place. Sartre also says that Tahani belongs “down there” too. 

**Tahani Al-Jamil** is a was raised in English high society. She studied at Oxford and attended the Sorbonne in France. Although she lived a very rewarding and successful life, Tahani constantly lived in the shadow of her older sister Kamilah. Kamilah was a Nobel prize winner and a Grammy-winning artist. Tahani’s biggest accomplishment in life was raising 60 billion dollars for charities and nonprofits, but it still wasn’t enough to make her parents proud. Unlike Jason, Tahani spent her life doing good for other people, so why does she belong in the Bad Place? Tahani lived her life in bad-faith. In many ways, Tahani is not unlike Sartre’s waiter. Sartre cautioned us not to become like this waiter- a man who moved too quickly and was too eager to please customers. The waiter was so committed to his job that he forgot that he was a person with free will first and a waiter second. By committing his life to his job, he was living a lie. Similarly, Tahani was living a lie by dedicating her life to helping others just to impress her parents. Tahani never developed any beliefs or morals of her own. She never worked for anything other than fame or recognition. She forgot that she was a free person who could have left her parents and sister behind and lived her own life. Additionally, Tahani committed another mortal sin according to Sartre. Tahani constantly dwells on the past by bringing up all the good deeds she performed on Earth. In one conversation while picking up trash Tahani says, “You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana. Doesn’t really matter what she’s a princess of. It’s not really important.”  Tahani’s casual name-dropping doesn’t stop there, as she routinely says things like, “I haven’t been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other friend Kanye, who was defending my best friend, Beyoncé.” Tahani, more than any other character, is obsessed with past achievements which Sartre warned would lead to replacing the current self with a past self, thus living a life in bad-faith. 

At first glance, it might seem that the existentialists wouldn’t have a problem with **Eleanor.** She lived a classically immoral life, scamming old people for a living, going to a coffee shop where the owner harasses people, and insisting on using the “10 items or less line” when checking out with a full cart at the grocery store. But even though most of her actions on Earth made everyone else around her worse off, Eleanor lived authentically and for herself. She wasn’t governed by an external moral code or by a strict dedication to a specific role. So does she belong in the real Good Place? Simone de Beauvoir says no. Eleanor is sent to the Bad Place because she is a textbook narcissist. Narcissism, as defined by de Beauvoir, is a “well-defined process of alienation: the self is posited as an absolute end and the subject escapes itself in it.” Whereas Tahani and Jason lived in bad-faith because they never developed belief systems of their own or stepped out of their roles in society to understand their freedom, it seems Eleanor swung too far the other way. As de Beauvoir would say “She is busy, but does not do anything [...] not being able to accomplish herself in any projects and aims.” Here de Beauvoir is speaking about housewives, but this applies to Eleanor too. Eleanor is completely absorbed in herself to the point of never dedicating her life to anything but her own pleasure. She quits an amazing job making lots of money just because she was expected to be friendly with her coworkers. Eleanor is so crippled by her wretched parents and terrible childhood that she never forms any type of identity or personal philosophy outside of herself. Instead of doing things because she thought she was right or basing decisions on a personal moral code, all of Eleanor's actions on Earth were her trying to prove others wrong. She didn't refuse to stop going to the coffee shop owned by a man who was filmed groping a woman during a job interview on principle, she kept going to Andy's Coffee because her boyfriend told her she shouldn't. 

Finally, we have **Chidi Anagonye.** On Earth Chidi was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, so one would think that he would be looked upon with the most grace by our existential philosophers. However, according to existential theory, Chidi is the most screwed out of the four main characters. Chidi is sent to the bad place because he is essentially just existential anxiety personified. Soren Kierkegaard defined anxiety as unfocused fear and likened it to the feeling a man gets when standing on the edge of a cliff. Looking down into the abyss below, the man is very scared of falling but he also feels an illogical urge to throw himself off the cliff. This is what Kierkegaard called the “dizziness of freedom.” This anxiety is described by Kierkegaard and many other existentialists as essential to recognizing one’s freedom of choice. However, Chidi should have heeded Kierkegaard’s advice when he said, ""become honest with yourself so that you do not deceive yourself with imagined power, with which you experience imagined victory in imagined struggle."" His entire life Chidi was paralyzed by the fear of making wrong choices. In primary school, Chidi kept everyone from playing soccer at recess because while picking teams he weighed the pros and cons of picking every kid in class for so long that recess ended before they could start a game. Later in life, he continued to make people miserable with his indecisiveness. Chidi ruined his relationship with his girlfriend when he was consumed by the guilt of lying to a coworker about liking a pair of boots. He once claimed that he missed his mother’s back surgery because “I promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him program his phone on the day of her surgery!” Eventually, his inability to make even the simplest of choices led to his death. Chidi died standing on the sidewalk when an air conditioning unit fell on him. He had been standing under it for 30 minutes just trying to pick a restaurant to go to. Chidi lived his entire life studying moral philosophy and yet never developed his own personal identity. Kierkegaard acknowledges that it is easy to get bogged down in the moral,  ethical or practical implications of any choice. Specifically, he uses the example of getting married. According to Kierkegaard you can either get married or you can choose not to get married, but both choices will lead to your unhappiness in some way or another. If you choose to get married you may fall out of love with your partner or the passion may die. But if you choose not to get married, you’ll be haunted by the fact that you never married the person you love. Because all choices will lead to our eventual unhappiness, the only correct choice is the one made in good faith. When we consider our own values and make a choice based on those values, we free ourselves from anxiety because we know the choices we made were our own. Chidi’s mortal sin was never identifying his own beliefs and making a choice for himself. 

The Good Place has offered us four distinct examples of how we shouldn’t live our lives, but unlike our four main characters, we’re not dead yet. So what does it say about how we should live? 
As I see it, using an existential point of view, The Good Place urges us to examine our pasts with a keen eye. If our main characters had taken the existential philosophers’ advice and questioned their preconceived notions about why things matter to them, they might have ended up in the actual Good Place. Just as we can learn from the writings of Sartre, de Beauvoir and Kierkegaard, we can learn from The Good Place too. We should learn from Jason to not let external forces dictate the choices we make. From Tahani, we should learn to challenge the roles we have accepted for ourselves and not let our past accomplishments become our identity. Eleanor teaches us to live for ourselves, but to not let our obsession with simple pleasures get in the way of actual self improvement. Lastly, Chidi teaches us to embrace the uncertainty of life. After all, we only get a short amount of time on Earth. We can either spend that time worrying about how to live it best, or we can just live.

Is the Medium Place more bad than good?,"Just a brief list of things we know about The Medium Place and whether they're good, bad or medium: 

* Mindy is completely alone (well for about 30 years until the others show up), and that would be enough to drive anyone crazy. **Verdict: Bad.** 

* Her jukebox only plays live versions of The Eagles and William Shatner poetry, so basically it would never get used. **Verdict: Bad.** 

* She has her favourite beer but it's always warm. **Verdict: Medium.** (A good beer would probably be ok regardless of temperature.) 

* She has access to water-stained Anne Rich vampire novels. **Verdict:** I've never read an Anne Rice novel so I'm hesitant to judge here, but reading the same books for 30 years sounds pretty **Bad.** 

* Much like the books, the only movies she has are Cannonball 2 and the making of the same film (although she does record a new video when she meets the others). **Verdict: Bad.**

* Mindy also clearly has a pretty extreme cocaine addiction, evidenced by the fact she was still desperate for some 30 years after last having any. Living like that could not be fun. **Verdict: Bad.**

The warm beer, to me, is the only true medium thing she gets to experience. She's an isolated, cocaine addict that uses masturbation as her main and only form of entertainment and this is meant to be a middling existence. Her life sounds just a few notches above The Bad Place rather than a middle ground (if we're to believe Michael's fake Good Place is similar to the real Good Place).

A few potential, more ""medium"" solutions to the above listed **bad** verdicts could be:

* Instead of being alone, she receives weekly visits from friends that she was only kind of close to, or friends of friends.

* Her jukebox only works for two hours a day and has random 50/50 chance of playing The Eagles and Shatner or her favourite songs.

* She has access to only 10 books. 5 that she loves and 5 that she hates, but she never knows what she's reading until she reads the first page and has to commit to reading the whole thing.

* Maybe something similar with the movies. I was thinking low-quality versions of her favourite movies but she was from the 80s so she might not as anal about quality as people these days are. Perhaps even access to her favourite films but the lead roles are always played by different actors, e.g. one day you're watching Mean Girls starring Lindsey Lohan, the next day it's Forest Whittaker.

* I'm not sure how I'd tackle cocaine one as I'm not too familiar with the realities of addiction or even taking cocaine.

I didn't plan to make this post this long but I'd be interested to hear other people's takes on The Medium Place as it immediately jumped out to me as The slightly-less-worse-than-the-Bad-Place, and further evidence only made it worse.",TheGoodPlace,1526990738,SheriffWoodley,63,186,True,False,False,True,2018-05-22
a Thought about sitcom relationships,"Spoilers for The Good Place, New Girl, and Parks&amp;Rec I guess

I've noticed in New Girl and Parks&amp;Rec there's this theme of mismatched couples that work. 

Example: Leslie and Chris versus Ann and Ben. There's an episode before Ann &amp; Chris leave where Ann and Ben are discussing how they're chosen such out-of-the-box people to love. It's similar to New Girl where Nick and Cece are the more relaxed, go with the flow type people for most of the show, whereas Jess and Schmidt are more plan/ career oriented. 

I also think this idea applies to The Good Place, where Eleanor, in the beginning, really aligned more with Jason in terms of being this laid back/ lost person in life. Compared to Chidi, who was equally hopeless, but in a much more structured, academic, career way.

This doesn't really add much to the show, I just wanted to see what others thought about this trend.

Some thoughts after finishing season 2,"Hey! I just finished binging the show, which I absolutely loved. Jason, Michael, Trevor (who I definitely hope will return sometime), Janet, Mindy and Vicky especially are treasures. I accidentally spoiled the first season for myself, but it didn't spoil anything; it made the show so much more interesting.


The only thing that bothers me a tiny bit and on which I'd like thoughts is the treatment of the main characters, especially Eleanor. I love her and she's funny, but she was easily the worst of all of them and absolutely doesn't deserve to end up in TGP. None of them do, but none of them went out of their way to be terrible like she did, and if it takes a demon bending over backwards to make her meet someone specific, then that's additional proof of her not being deserving of ending up in heaven! She had a terrible upbringing, but so did/do lots of other people and those who didn't manage to become ""good"" didn't get do-overs and favours like she did. I feel bad because I feel like we're supposed to be rooting for her as *the* main character (I also wish the other 3 got more prominence than they currently do haha), but I don't even think she should be in the medium place... Almost everyone has the capacity to change and that's great, but that's not on their capacity that people are judged but by their actions. I'm gonna be quite disappointed if that show doesn't end with a major reform of the system if the 4 mains get in.

That's definitely the only thing that tarnishes slightly my enjoyment of the show, it was perfect until actually getting into TGP became seriously entertained!",TheGoodPlace,1527284061,riddle_me_this1,7,6,True,False,False,True,2018-05-25
Fan Theory About What the Good Place Really Is. Spoilers season 1/2,"What's up everyone, literally just binged both seasons a couple of days ago in the span of two days. I have been thinking a lot about it and wanted to bounce this idea off of you all:

The Good Place doesn't exist. At least, its not a location in the sense of a ""place,"" but a ""location"" in the sense of a state of being, namely, the state of non-existence. Those who make it to the ""Good Place"" no longer exist, they truly die.

Why do I think this? For one, our knowledge of who goes to the good place, what the good place is, etc is completely flipped on its head at the end of S1. Michael explained how its a neighborhood of 322 residents every time, with a certain number of points (the exact cutoff is left vague to my knowledge). But we find out that this neighborhood was simply a construct designed to torture those four humans. We don't know that it truly represents the real good place at all, because I don't believe even Michael knows it.

Now the fact that Michael claims to be an all-knowing being is what led me down this road; he eventually admits that he doesn't know how to get to the good place. All he knows is that there is a judge who can determine it. 

So why do I think this is what the good place would be? Well, we are confronted with various ideas of a peaceful afterlife, i.e. what paradise should be. Even our own fanbase (and Kristen Bell herself) are split between thinking a true good place would be blissful and peaceful, while others think it should be a place where one is constantly being challenged and growing as a person. But something in the finale got me thinking. When Shawn condemns Michael to his punishment, is it retirement (basically their version of death)? No, its an eternal life, but one spent in a locked room in perpetuity. At that moment I thought how much more preferable it would be to end existence and awareness than have to spend literally eternity in there. And from there I thought how it would be better to end (at some point!) than be aware for literal eternity in any state, in any condition. I think that is the true good place.",TheGoodPlace,1527301681,DaylanHammer,37,99,True,False,False,True,2018-05-25

At the end of episode 9, Michael says that getting to the portal in the middle of the Bad Place would be pointless because it would surely end in failure, but decided to do it anyways because it was a “human” thing to do. But in the next episode, it seems like it would be really easy to get there? If the crew hadn’t accidentally walked into the museum commemorating them, they probably would have never been discovered and could walk right through, and if Shawn hadn’t raided Mindy’s the “illegal” way then there would have been no problems with just casually strolling to the portal. Even with the humans and Michael all having been discovered, all Jake Jortles had to was throw a Molotov cocktail and we cut to the portal with plenty of time to spare to hop in and for Michael to give an extended speech to Eleanor.

How does the passage of time work?,"The multiple reboots in season 2 are estimated to add up to at least a few hundred years if the average times are to be believed. 

If the reality that the show takes place in exists outside of the passage of time in the living world this isn’t an issue, but it feels like because they select people out who die at roughly the same time on earth and observe them as dots that there is some basic relation between the two. 

If this is the case and 1 year simulated in the afterlife is equal to 1 year in the living world, shouldn’t everyone who the human characters ever knew in life also be dead and in any/either/all of the afterlife realities they’ve found themselves in?

It’s something I hoped Eleanor or Chidi to have challenged and I would have especially expected this thought to occur to Tahani when she was failing her judge’s test with her parents. Even if she knew those parents were fake and part of the test, it was her first time ‘seeing’ them again and would have provoked that logical question to follow.

Or do they all just accept that most or all people they knew in life are somewhere in the real Bad Place, being tortured?",TheGoodPlace,1527345963,Artichoke19,4,21,True,False,False,True,2018-05-26
Season 2 Finale hidden Message...?,"The bar that Eleanor goes to at the end of the episode which famously has Michael tending the bar is called “Sting’s Deser Rose”

I decided to look up the lyrics to that song...


I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
**I realise that nothing's as it seems**
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
**This memory of Eden haunts us all**
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall

I think no matter how powerful Gen the judge is, it’s probably not within their ability/legality to bring people actually back to life. 

This seems like a totally new simulation to see what would happen. I see this timeline going on for several episodes, but then perhaps some of the other demons finding out and maybe trying to mess with them?  Then another kind of reset...

This kinda implies she said the L word to this said person, doesn't it? However, in Season 2 episode 3 Eleanor also mentions 'I've only ever said ""I love you"" to two men my entire life, Stone Cold Steve Austin and a guy in a dark club who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.'. Now to me it seems like Stone Cold Steve Austin may have been said person she hooked up with behind the port-a-potties seeing as we already know where the look-a-like was.

But let's think about how long they've been in the Bad Place. There were over 800 attempts, the shortest being a few seconds and the longest being 11 months.  We can't really know exactly, but doesn't it seem like they were going through these versions for around 100 years? Is Joe Francis nearly 150 in this universe, that seems unlikely and terrifying. They talk about time and months and years in the Bad Place \(Shawn and Michael both do in meetings\), but does perhaps it not run linearly?  I assumed that the newest events were a simulation as well, but maybe they can manipulate time somehow.

She did get a different soul mate at first but I think having a house that she likes would work better along with a perfect soulmate. If more things weren't so bothersome to her (clam chowder fountain, soul mate performing jazz to her) then maybe she would feel the guilt stronger because she's getting rewarded for her bad behavior. 
She will always know that she's not a good person, and sticking her out so much as the odd ball in the group with her actions affecting the environment, I feel that any person would figure out their being tortured. ",TheGoodPlace,1528047589,kimiko1443,6,48,True,False,False,True,2018-06-03

The first episode is seriously one of if not the best opening episodes of a show that I've ever seen,"Tl;dr: Watched it high, it was amazing. Watched again sober, still just as amazing. Not gonna be a pretentious twat and say it was a ""masterful work of art"" or anything, but it sure as hell was an amazing opener that, imo, does the whole season justice.

When I first watched the first episode, me and a friend were stoned off our asses. She asked me what kind of show I wanted to watch, and I, having just smoked a copious amount of weed, said very vaguely that I wanted to watch something ""atmospheric"". She almost instinctually pulled up the good place, and we got right in. It was a bit slow for my stoner sensibilities at first, but very quickly I was pulled right in.

The calm, peaceful attitude that the residents of the good place seemed to have, combined with the eccentric, whimsical personality of Michael made for a delightful introduction and story flow, climaxing in the brilliant reveal about Eleanor (the one that serves as the main premise for a large part of season 1. You know what I'm referring to) made sure that, even though I was high off my rocker, 110% of my attention was focused on the show. Additionally, the unnecessary but very, very much appreciated details, most notably (imo) Michael's mannerisms, I.E. his quirky way of speaking, the way he moved his hands while speaking, only made me love it more.


I don't want to make this too much longer, so I'll skip to the part that really made me sure this episode was a gold standard: Near the end of the episode, Eleanor wakes up to Ariana Grande playing. She walks over to the window, opens the curtains, and it appears that all surrealistic-hell has broken loose: A Giant lady bug, a giant frog, flying shrimp, missiles flying, just all kinds of amazing, insane pandemonium. When I was high, the sudden shift from the ""perfect"", serene atmosphere to the absurdist, surrealistic, intense atmosphere had me completely and totally astonished, in the most positive and amazed sense of the word. Having rewatched episode 1 completely sober, that sudden switch to absurdity still sends shivers down my spine, simply because of how fantastic it was. 

It's possible that I'm just over appreciative of it because the first time I saw it, I was very, very high. I mean, even a stupid magic trick from the fuckin dollar tree could ""astonish"" someone who was as stoned as I was, after all. But I honestly believe that, sober or otherwise, the brilliant premise, the hilarious jokes, the great character development, and most importantly, the fantastic world building, can all stand their own ground as an example of how excellent design, direction, and writing can create an even more excellent product.

I know I'm preaching to the choir a bit here, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on the show, and this seemed like a good place (ha) to do it. And don't worry, I don't take the show too seriously. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's the new Citizen Kane or whatever. I do however sincerely believe it's one of the best tv comedies this decade, and certainly the best(spoiler tagged the genre cause its sorta a spoiler for people just starting the show) [dystopian](/sp) comedy I've ever seen. It's just a great show.

Spoilers for Season Two- Why it may not be a simulation after all...,"Spoilers for season two!
At the end of season Two, eleanor wakes up in the 'real world' and eventually meets Chidi, after a year of being saved by Michael. Fans found it strange that Chidi could speak English at the end of the season finale, even though in Season One, episode one, he said he was speaking french but his speech was translated to english via the magic of the good place. Because of this, fans assumed that the 'real world' Eleanor was in was indeed a simulation made by the Judge and Michael. 
However, hear me out.
We know The Afterlife is timeless. This is because after Mindy Saint Clair arrived in the Afterlife, she was bought to the medium place because of all the good her operation (led by her sister) did. As Mindy had just started the operation when she died, the after life must be a place irrevelant to time or at least capeable of bringing people to the Good, bad, or medium place whenever they want. 
So, it is fair to assume that Eleanor, Michael, Jason, and Chidi did not die a the same time but instead were bought to 'The Good Place' at the same time. 
This means that while Eleanor had her life saved by Michael, years before that Chidi could have had his life saved by Michael. (remember chidi's death scene? it was kinda hillarious). 
So, when Eleanor meets Chidi in the end of the Season 2 finale, Chidi could have been saved from death years before that, and therefore have time to change himself and learn English.

[Theory] Season 2 finale and season 3,"SPOILERS AHEAD! you have been warned!


I binge watched both seasons this weekend after coming across it randomly. While I predicted the twist ending of season one as Kristen Bell was living my version of what hell is like down to the creepy clowns and the nicey nice no swearing, I found the season two's finale.... odd. 


My theory. What if they are still in the bad place not reincarnated. The Judge is just one of the demon actors, I mean she seasons her food with envy! Whenever Kristen tries to be good those around her bring her down with a lead pipe. When she circles back to her old ways Micheal nudges her to try again so she's always wavering between the two and never achieving either. 


First season a fake heaven. Second season is actually purgatory as they're faced with their flaws. Third season is actual hell with them starting in limbo (wavering between good and bad) then making themselves miserable while trying to reach the so called good place which is always dangled infront of them but like a balloon already floating away is out of their reach.

Season 2 finale theory,"Spoilers for the finale ahead, you have been warned!


There was something very fishie in the finale. I actually re-watched the last three episodes and they were... odd. 


1. Mendoza used a Molotov cocktail to create a wall of fire between them and the demons to make their escape. 

Why would that matter to demons? They adore fire and the show went out of it's way to frame that in a previous episode of the same season! 


2. The judge seasons her food with the envy, actual envy.



3. Mendoza's test makes no sense. She wanted him to actually think out of the box and ask not to play? She wanted him to think at all? 


My theory is that the show is allowing itself one of two paths to use in case the network gave them another season. 


Path A. the obvious one, they are still in the bad place being tortured. The judge is a demon playing her role and the whole thing was by design because the demons are having some fun with the humans. They use the self improvement guise and make their after-life a struggle that goes no where (they do good, it backfires. They relapse and it feels bad so they try again. repeat.)


Path B. A different direction. 

There is no bad place. This really is the good place, they are put through it all because secretly they wanted to be better and never got the chance on earth. well here's a chance and the angles/demons are one and the same. They're job is to push you in whatever direction your soul wants to go... with St. Clair being the one stagnating because she refuses to move from her spot.",TheGoodPlace,1528339906,Kidlike101,7,34,True,False,False,True,2018-06-06

This continues in the final episode of season 2, when Chidi gives a 3-hour long seminar in perfect English and without any noticeable accent.

Why I think the real Good Place doesn't exist,"The Good Place has been teasing us for two seasons about what the actual Good Place looks like – first, by setting up our expectations throughout season 1, and, when we accepted their version of it, knocking it down like dominoes. There is something that needs to be clarified before proceeding. If there is an afterlife in The Good Place Universe (TGPU hereafter), then death is clearly not the same as just ceasing to exist. Although our four humans are very much dead, they haven’t stopped existing. As of Season 2, they exist Somewhere Else (ignoring the part where they are back on Earth/in a simulation of the Earth). Of course, there are certain things I’m hoping the show clears up next season, which I will talk about at the end. 
Now, to begin presenting my arguments for why I think the real Good Place doesn’t exist. These are in two parts: arguments that suggest The Good Place doesn’t exist, and arguments that suggest The Good Place is actually ceasing to exist. 
To start off with the first kind, there has been no real description of the Good Place by any character except for the fact that no one seems to know how to get there, whereas we’ve heard loads about the Bad Place and have even seen the Medium Place. Secondly, the only character we know who belongs to the real Good Place is Janet, but this “fact” may as well be false. We know that Michael stole her and said that “They just leave them lying around,” but if the Good Place itself is so well guarded that not even Michael knows how to get there, why would they just leave their Janets lying around? If everyone outside the Good Place is bad, the Janets would of course be in a lot of danger of being misused. Furthermore, we know that this show is good at overturning its own premise more than once. However, the only premise set up since the pilot that hasn’t been turned on its head (and that we have very easily taken for granted), is that there even exists a Good Place. Who’s to say the whole thing isn’t an experiment to see if the very idea of a Good/Bad/Medium place works or not? Speaking of which, the reason for not sending the humans to the Good Place (that they only seek moral dessert) given by the Judge seems more of an excuse to me than a reason. Isn’t the whole concept of doing the right thing based on moral dessert? Even if people don’t explicitly do good things just to ensure moral dessert in the afterlife, they do them for satisfaction/a clear conscience/ eternal gains in the form of a legacy. Also, it is unfair to say that those who did good did so because they were seeking moral dessert while at the same time making the bad people suffer moral punishment.
This brings me to the reasons for why I think the real Good Place is not a place, but a condition of not existing at all. As we know, TGP bears a striking resemblance to Jean Paul Sartre’s No Exit. By the end of the play (as by the end of season 1), the characters conclude that “Hell is other people”.  However, being completely alone is not so good either. Mindy St. Claire (who seems to have more bad than good in her way, according to this Reddit post) lives alone, and to be honest, looks very tortured when the four first meet her. This means that even if you’re given something medium, the constancy of it makes it bad over time. If you’re alone, you get bored. If you’re with other people, that’s its own kind of torture. In the end, it doesn’t matter what you get, you’re going to get tired of it eventually. The opposite is no better either – if everything kept changing all the time, you would never have the time to enjoy everything peacefully. If you had to move to a different house and a different climate almost every day, surely, you’d be tired of it in a while. True bliss then, is simply to stop existing then, because the only way you won’t be tortured is if you don’t exist. As long as you exist, you have expectations, boredom, and familiarity breeding contempt, or constant flux.",TheGoodPlace,1528750895,charu_stark,6,3,True,False,False,True,2018-06-11

(Theory) (spoilers) Why Chidi is in the bad place,"Of all the people, Chidi seems the least likely to be in the bad place. It's revealed in season 2 that Chidi's life is talking about how to be a good person. His only ""crime"" was a mental condition that he couldn't control. So why wouldn't the Good Place try to get him? I think that the good place allowed Chidi to go to the bad place so that he could change it. The good place angels are likely spying on the bad place to find its weaknesses. When they found that Chidi, an ethics teacher, would be talking directly to a demon if he went to the bad place, they may have let them have him. The Bad Place may have thought it was because it wasn't good enough, but the good place may have known that Chidi would be able to destroy the whole ""good vs bad"" system and get people proper justice

In summary, Chidi was allowed to go to the BP by the GP so he could get rid of the messed up justice system the afterlife has. ",TheGoodPlace,1528994689,MrMapleBar,32,11,True,False,False,True,2018-06-14

Michael and Eleanor,"Why do I feel like there is something with Michael and Eleanor.


Season 2 Episode 4

Something at Attempt #801 changed Michael. 
Michael was also quite frustrated to the point where he seeked advice unto Jason.

Season 2 Episode 5

Michael had the dilemma of realizing the idea of not existing. (DEATH SIMPLY) Eleanor told him that everyone is simply unhappy everytime.

Season 2 Episode 6

Michael began torturing Chidi and Eleanor (Again) to blow off some steam and Eleanor gave an advice about how Michael was ""Pulling an Eleanor."" lashing out when you feel like a failure. And realizing how Similar Michael and Eleanor are. And Michael accepting the advice that Eleanor gave him.


Season 2 Episode 7

Michael was supposed to stop the wedding but he steps back and asked Eleanor to do it instead because chidi got to his head.

Michael also held some fascination on seeing how Eleanor changed.(From knowing all the bad things that Eleanor did on earth) because I think he himself felt like he changed too. 

Season 2 Episode 10 

Eleanor: Be careful.

Michael:Be careful? Oh! Are you worried about me?

Eleanor: Yeah Im worried. I mean. Cause you're our ticket out of here. Genius. Don't be all goofy on me.

Micahel: Just worry about them. I'll be fine.


Season 2 Episode 11

Michael gave Eleanor the pin. He sacrificed himself and even kinda solved the trolley problem.


Season 2 Episode 12

Michael gave Eleanor a little ""Push"" And gave her the same advice that she had given to Michael. (Episode 7 little voices on her head. Her conscience.)

From their Michael gave her a push towards Chidi from saying ""What do we owe each other."" 

Which you can also relate to the ripped page of the book ' What do we owe each other' that Eleanor had written ""FIND CHIDI""


 
And what's up with Michael why do I feel like he is becoming human. I know the whole point of the Ethics lesson is to help Michael learn about being human but still it's really odd on how he began reacting to things.

Everything seem to revolve around. Michael has a problem- Eleanor resolves it or helps him overcome it.

After binge watching the good place,"I really enjoyed the series, it was pretty solid but I have a lot of criticisms. 

First and foremost, Chidi does not belong there. Jason does not belong there. Tahani does not belong there. Eleanor does not belong there.

Chidi is there because his indecision causes harm to others. That is not a logical argument. The very nature of being good is indecision because in a world full of complex working morally grey choices, it is nearly impossible to be ""good"" (which effectively destroys the whole notion of an afterlife on its own)

Jason is a moron. Someone being intellectually disadvantaged and presented a poor ability to develop cannot inherently be a bad person. This is clearly even shown by his simple logic. I throw a molotov (A) and my problem changes (B) its reactionary. It's simple. 

Tahani only wants the love and approval of her parents. A biological need that drives her to do good and better things. This doesn't make her selfish, nobody is entirely altruistic, this is something that they haven't even brought up in the work of ethics (ethnics) yet. There is always a driving force and mechanism behind the actions that are ""good""

and lastly, Eleanor, who honestly, of the three is the only real ""Shitty"" person made evident by her constant nagging of how ""I deserve a medium place"". While she is depicted a ""victim"" of her circumstances she already made clear relevance to the fact she knew what she was doing was ""wrong"" and chose to do it anyway. Which is inherently ""bad"". 

So as a whole, the cast set up is kind of dumb when trying to present the premise of people being eternally punished. Especially when the premise for season 3 is now ""They'll change so they can get in the good place because they don't know the good place exists"" but its the same repeated nonsense (good nonsense, delivered by great actors, and great chemistry) of the first 2 seasons. Eleanor can not and will not change without Chidi. That is a HUGE problem. If all it takes is one person to define another, then people are being damned to torture over something they have zero control over. Inherently people do not exhibit free will and rely on a number of circumstances in which decide their behavior. This was only made evident by over 800 resets in the good bad place. 

So Season 3 is presenting with a pretty shit opus and I'm not overly enthused to see it. I had hoped that the character development at this point would have carried the show forward to illustrate how they can get others to change. A third season where you meet people who are inherently ""bad"". This way it clearly draws a line between our group and them taking it away from a question of ""free will not existing"" and ""victims of circumstance"" to an innate nature of cruelty, although even if that too were the case its destroyed by the fact that due to the variable nature of individuality and circumstances the fact a heaven/hell good/bad yes/no place even exists is entirely flawed.",TheGoodPlace,1529430474,DesMephisto,22,0,True,False,False,True,2018-06-19

Thoughts and Questions about their tests,"I think Elanor's test is perfect and was a good test to see how much she's come to understand ethics and Chidi.

Chidi's test was unfair. There are so many tests within tests and switcheroos in this afterlife, that he had ever right to think there might something more to the test than choosing a hat.

Tahani's test - she is NEVER told not to look in the other doors. She just has to get to the door at the end of the hall. So, popping into one room, having a listen, then moving on, doesn't seem to break the rules.

But Jason's test. I don't understand it at all. He had to play Madden (that was Madden, right?) as the Titans against the Jaguars. I get how that would be challenging. But how was he supposed to know to ask if he could opt out of playing? I really don't understand the point of his test at all.

Realised why I didn't see the twist coming and it has given me an idea for where I think the story will end up. [FULL SPOILERS],"So I am laying in bed on maybe my 7th or 8th binge rewatch of The Good Place and I had a bit of a theory, wanted to see what you guys thought about it. Haven't been to this sub before sorry if this is a popular theory already.

So on my first watch through of TGP I really loved the story concept because like most people when I watch TV I like to think about what I would do in those situations. I really connected with all six main characters in different ways, as I'm sure most of you do, because the four main characters are all such exaggerations of certain personality types. However, I really bonded with Chidi and that will become relevant later. I really find the quirky comedy tone mixed with the moments of real emotion and serious discussion about life, morality and reality just really helped me see things in a less serious more comical light through a bit of a dark time while I was suffering from existential crises and serious depression. I enjoyed thinking about how the different parts of my personality would act in the fictional afterlife, but of course some parts of my personality wouldn't get into The Good Place which is why I think I didn't see the twist coming. Everything made sense and even though I don't believe in an afterlife I would like to think that I am overall a good person. The aspects of my personality that I shared with Chidi have been a very relevant factor in my life recently, especially at the time of my first viewing (I have G.A.D.) I would like to think that  anxieties and indecisiveness don't necessarily make you a bad person, so I had no reason to think there was any reason why he would deserve to be in The Bad Place. And although I very much dislike people like Tahani, I can still believe that she would get in too. Once I realised this it made the twist a little disappointing because Chidi's character focuses so heavily on his anxiety. It made me think that maybe other people have connected with certain aspects of characters and also didn't see it coming for a similar reason. 

So here's where I think the show will go. There is no such thing as The Good Place or The Bad Place. The entire experience is a way for the four main characters to right the negative aspects of their personalities before moving on to an afterlife for everyone. Everyone has to go through it and the worse a person you are, the harder it is, hence why Eleanor and Jason are in a more slighty more stressful situation than Chidi and Tahani during Season 1.
  
The main thing that kind of ruins it a bit is the scenes not involved the main characters make a little bit less sense, particularly interactions between Michael and Sean. 

I'd like to know what you guys think. I think this theory holds a lot of weight and would be a great way to end the story with another satisfying twist that also leaves you feeling better about yourself.

My day on the Set of the Good Place,"My current day job is as a background actor for TV and film and seat filler for reality TV and game shows. A couple weeks ago, I got booked to work on The Good Place. /cue happy dance and fangirl screaming

So I figured this sub would be interested in my experience around the main actors and crew of this amazing show.

It started out with a very early call time at the crack of dawn at a location just outside of LA. Nothing out of the ordinary for any TV show. I was sent through wardrobe, hair and makeup (all women in the background wear light pink lipstick or lip gloss as a rule, which apparently helps the light color scheme of the entire show) and then told to wait outside as production was considering using my car in the background of the scene. After an hour or two, it was time to film and my car was ultimately not used so I was invited to come over to the set and watch filming because they were doing an exciting stunt that day. At this point, everyone I've encountered has been super nice, kind and accommodating. 

On set, everyone was there; all the main actors, even though Ted, Manny, and Jameela were the only ones in the scene, were on set, watching and supporting, rather than staying in their trailers even though it was an extremely hot day. This is beyond rare for a TV set--most of the time actors will sit in their trailers until the very last minute and only be on set when absolutely necessary. So filming the first scene of the day goes on and the stunt goes amazing, with Michael Schur hopping out of his producers' tent for a bit. 

Once the scene is finished, we're all sent back inside to our holding (just a large room to hold all the background actors out of the heat) and we prep for the next scene. Since I wasn't in the first scene, I was placed very close to the main actors in this scene. I couldn't talk to them, but I was close enough to hear them joke around between scenes which warmed my fangirl heart. However, one sad thing for me is that to remind the main actors of the context of this scene, the entire main arc of season 3 was announced. The only detail I'm going to tell you is that the scene we were filming takes place in a European airport and there is such high production value within this show that they had converted the American electrical outlets to European style ones. This ended our day of filming at barely noon, but production let us hang around for lunch.

Being allowed to stay for lunch was just the cherry on top of the day since production had no obligation to let us stay around. At lunch, the main cast ate at the same tables that everyone in the production--the crew, the background actors, the security guards, etc--and again, this is extremely rare for productions so it just shows how nice these people are.

Unfortunately, I will not be giving out details of what was spoiled for me because of the paperwork I signed as a term of my employment. Feel free to ask me anything about my job.

TLDR: No spoilers for you guys (sorry for those thirsty for new details!), The Good Place is just a really nice set to work on and working on it made me love this show 100x more. Keep watching the show, we're supporting an amazingly kind and friendly workplace in addition to one of the best shows on TV.",TheGoodPlace,1531029811,katherkelly,34,150,True,False,False,True,2018-07-08
Doug is Coming! I have predictions for s3!!,"Whoa! Holy Shirtballs!

I saw the list of episode names for Season 3, and I just had a major brainwave!

Doug Forcett! His name is mentioned in two of the titles, so clearly they’re going to meet him. Maybe even make him a major plot point.

So here are my predictions for Season 3: Team Cockroach have met up, and start studying ethics, as expected. How, exactly, they get Tahani and Jason into the Mix, I’m not sure.

Option One: I’m betting something happens, and Eleanor storms off, or for that matter, thinks to herself : “I’ve been good for a whole season now, I wanna blow off some steam. Hey look, a Party!""

So she goes, and sits with some Stoners, and they pass around some mushrooms, and then Elanor, reflecting on her ethics lessons and the idea of 'Moral Dessert' suddenly says ""Hey, what do you think the afterlife is like?""

And then this guy sitting next to her says: ""Well, my name is Doug, and when I was a kid back in Calgary, I had this idea..."" and launches into this incredible monologue where he gets 92% of it right, and Eleanor, tripping, staring, losing her mind, suddenly gets struck by the thunderbolt, and Remembers! She remembers The Good Place, Micheal, and Hot Diggity Dog!

Option Two: Based on the thought that the picture of Doug was a producer's choice instead of an actor, (As suggested by the podcast) then maybe there have been many 'Dougs'. (The title of 3x11 backs this up) and there are others who have been 'rebooted' into their life on earth.

So one day, Jason, or Eleanor are passing a joint back and forth, talking about their 'ethnics' classes with Chidi, and Eleanor asks 'Hey, what do you think the afterlife is like?' and Jason launches into the full monologue. Cut to the end of the season, where a random supporting S3 cast member has died unexpectedly, and is met by Micheal. 

""John Smith? Come on in. You, are dead. Welcome to the next phase of your existence.""

""Cool. So, who got it right?""

""Well, the Christians, the Buddhists, all the major religions got it about 5% right. but then there was Jason Mendoza. He was this amateur DJ in Florida, who got high one night, and got it about 95% right, breaking the record of Doug Forcett by 3%.""

""Okay... So, where am I?""

""Well, you're pretty lucky. A few months ago, you would have been in the Good place, or the Bad Place. But then this thing happened with some friends of mine, and we're trial-programming a Medium Place; where you can learn about ethics, and show your colors. It's a way to make sure you end up where you're meant to be.""

""And who are these friends of yours?""

""Well, you'd be surprised actually, you know them.""",TheGoodPlace,1531039068,stephensmat,15,20,True,False,False,True,2018-07-08

I stuck to my goals, made some hard decisions, felt really happy, content and wholesome-my best version. 

I was quite content with my life until a few weeks back when I started noticing there are people at a better state with far less efforts. It doesn’t seem fair(maybe it is the dumbest word humans invented).  And there are always going to be things that can still be worked upon.

[Spoiler!] I think I found another early clue for “the twist”,"In episode 3 of the first season, Michael is talking to Chidi about his manuscript and how much it sucked.

After rewatching this I saw this as a bit of a hint towards the twist where in season 2 (part 2 of the show) the exact opposite of what we all thought to be the premise of the show is true.

This Show Is Forking Amazing!,"I finished the show in less than 48 hours. I started it on the 10th and finished it on the 11th, It was absolutely amazing.


I was interested in the show after seeing Ideas at Play's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URXF9CF3M-k , no real spoilers in the video if you haven’t seen the show) and the show did not disappoint. 


First of, the cast has great chemistry together, it's been a long time since I've seen such good chemistry. They also all have great line delivery and good timing for their comedic moments. Furthermore, most of their characters have their own brand of comedy associated to their character which makes the show even more diverse in it’s comedy. And The Good Place manages to do this without being repetitive. Even characters that we don’t see that much feel like characters and not like paper cut outs. All of this is evident in their comedy, dialogue and everything about them and it helps bring every character to life. 


And all of this is without mentioning the actors, who portray these characters so well. Props to every one of them for being so great at their jobs. 


To add to the earlier bit about comedy. I'm not “good” with comedies in general, for the lack of a better term (I honestly can’t think of one at the moment). They don’t really click with me and it's usually hard for them to make me laugh. The last thing that made me really laugh was The Nice Guys, so I’m really glad that this show manages to be really funny. I think my favorite jokes are the Plato/Aristotle one with Eleanor and the Burrito Judge in S2 since I actually thought the Judge was going to be a burrito because of Michael mentioning the Pancakes earlier. 


To continue, I didn’t know about the twist so it really surprised me (I loved *The Laugh* by Ted Danson, it conveys everything we need to know) and after that the show just kept on giving. You have no clue where it's going and that’s great for the viewer since the show isn’t predictable. Also, it just keeps giving you ideas and story-lines you weren't expecting but what's outstanding is that they work every time, something that doesn't happen all the time in TV. Usually, you would expect an idea to not work out well, but not here. This gives me so much confidence in the cast and crew. They know what works and what doesn’t. Schur shows this when he explains why the characters didn’t stay in the proper Bad Place longer : “We are trying not to stagnate. I'd rather leave a place, or a premise, too early than too late.” All of this bodes well for the future of the show, after all it has already managed to reinvent itself more than once already, so it can probably do it again.


Thirdly, I know this may be seen as cheesy by some but seeing people bond and become better people is such a good idea for television. I know it's been done multiple times since that’s kind of the point of a lot of stories (seeing the protagonist evolve), but the way it was done here was great. At first you thought it was just going to be Eleanor who learns to be better, and then you start to wonder if things are wrong because of how the main characters act (Jason, Tahani and Chidi). After we know everything, they all have to learn to become the best version of themselves, even Michael. I especially like seeing Michael learn to become better, since it shows us that truly anybody can change. I even grew attached to his character. His answer to the trolley problem had me worried, since I thought it was over for him. Fortunately, Janet managed to “evolve” as well (this is also great since it goes hand in hand with what Eleanor was telling Chidi about lying).


To add to this, another thing that I feel makes these characters work so well is that in real life it would be so unlikely for all these people to meet and bond. However, because of their situation they are able to bond and grow together. 


I also love the lessons the characters learn at the end of each episodes. It makes the show feel so wholesome. Not to mention, that the atmosphere of the show is wholesome as well, well you know without the whole torturing part. I especially like the color palette and color correction that is used in “The Good Place”, it’s warm, with bright colors and makes you think everything is fine until it isn’t.


Finally, I unironically love all the philosophical stuff within the show. It manages to convey the ideas concisely. It also conveys them in a way that allows everyone will learn about them. The show also manages to cover different ideas and topics as well so it isn’t repetitive. Like one article said, it made philosophy cool. This helps the show stand out. 


Sorry if this is too long, rambly and disorganized, I just wanted to talk with people about this great show. Can’t wait for S3 in September. Also, even though more people know about the show now, I still feel like it’s not as popular as it should be.


I also have had one thing on my mind. How is the turnaround for this show so fast? I’m asking this since in recent times more time takes place between seasons. However, it seems as though The Good Place is on the opposite side of this spectrum. Season 1 premiered in 2016 and lasted until early 2017. Season 2 premiered in 2017 and lasted until early 2018. And now Season 3 premieres in September. Is this usual for Schur shows or is The Good Place an anomaly?

P.S. Is this just me not remembering correctly or do they switch the pronunciation of Eleanor from time to time (talking specifically about the *nor* part)

Started Watching this Show Two Weeks Ago on Netflix. Finished Season Two Last Night. Some Pointless Thoughts (Spoilers),"First, since I study Japanese I watched the show with Japanese dubbed audio. For that, I watched each episode once with English subtitles, then again with Japanese subtitles before moving on to the next. Not an easy thing to do with the awesome cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Side note: this is good tip to follow if you're learning a foreign language and have that option available for shows you want to watch. However, certain jokes about voices such as Tihani's accent don't make as much sense but that's minor. Also, I'm slowly rewatching the first season with my wife and so far she's enjoying it. 

Anyway, before I get into it, I'll admit I did not see the season 1 plot twist coming. This is very surprising given I knew a twist was coming as that was mentioned in the YouTube comics of a cartoon that used The Good Place as a mash-up with Marvel. Even better is that the twist was deserved. However, I think I was the most disturbed at the idea that they can have 80 demons dedicated to torturing 1 human soul. 

Also noted by others, I love how they had cliffhangers on every episode. Pretty sure this is standard now, but man it gets you wanting to play the next episode immediately. I can imagine people binging a season or even both seasons in a day.

I enjoyed the characters, but they all seemed almost too comically flawed. Jason is way too stupid. Tahini is way too conceited, Chidi is way to indecisive, and Eleanor is way to self-centered. I'll be honest, I hated all their pre-death versions as persons when they showed up in flashbacks (funny as hell though). Still, it's a comedy and they tried to temper that extreme as the episodes went on. 

Michael and Janet were great. While Michael had the most growth, like most I enjoyed Janet's antics more. The supporting demons were funny (more so on rewatch). Except Vicky. Fork Vicky. Most importantly, the story did not drag. This same show stretched out to 22 episodes would be a pain to watch with way too much filler. I'm glad broadcast TV is willing to move away that idea since now a show that tells a great linear story will likely be watched more on streaming services. 

Anyway, looking forward to season three and seeing how each of the characters react in the short term to a near death experience (yeah, I know, it's a simulation). I imagine Tahini almost being crushed by her sister('s statue) will impact her the most. Not sure what oxygen deprivation will do to Jason, but perhaps a vision will turn him to becoming a real monk (he seemed to fill that role way too easy). Chidi looks like he became more decisive. I just wonder how Michael and Janet will play into all of this and how their characters will grow. ",TheGoodPlace,1532135607,Nukemarine,2,22,True,False,False,True,2018-07-20

"(Spoilers) ""But that's the point of the show!"" Is Getting A Bit Tired","I'm guilty of it. ""The point of the show is that the system is bad!"" But actually, I'm reconsidering that. The point of the show isn't actually that the system is bad - though it certainly hints at it. Thus far the show's been playing within the boundaries set by the rules, despite things like Michael extending the fake good place, and everybody marching themselves to the judge by sneaking past demons, and getting re-alived. It's not like they're breaking rules and having whoever's in charge change their minds - they're just breaking rules and sometimes getting yelled at for it. The Bad Place management seem to break rules without a care, unless it helps humans. Therefore the point of the show seems less about the system itself being bad (though that is bubbling there) and more about how kinda shirty people coming together can help them to be good.

Here's the problem I have - ""but that's the point of the show!"" is in response to people talking about how the main characters shouldn't be in The Bad Place. But saying ""the point of the show is to prove the system is bad!"" misses half the point being made, which is that the main characters shouldn't be being treated like bad people at all. The framing of the show makes things like abuse and anxiety seem like personal faults, and that's nothing to do with the system. That's everything to do with the characters and how things are treated within the show. It treats a support system like it can only be specific people (I understand why Team Cockroach are being put together, and I know Eleanor did join a group of Good people after being saved from death, but they clearly weren't friends or helping her personally). When Eleanor gets upset that being good costs her friends and makes her feel unappreciated and tired, she's told she's seeking moral desert and led to Chidi.

I really get that the characters themselves are flawed, complex, and stumbling blindly through ethical conundrums, and that the supposed point of the show is to go ""the system is bad!"" but it kinda hurts when you see someone so clearly not trying to do bad - and who you can see yourself in, especially in the relevant flaws - still (thus far) called a bad person by the narrative.",TheGoodPlace,1532421580,Lixa123,8,5,True,False,False,True,2018-07-24

An idea about the shows meta commentary,"It seems that in the shows model of what “the bad place” is and Michael’s new idea, the divide between the psychological torture and physical more obvious one is clear.
At the end of season 1 when Michael is talking to the actors/bad place workers about how they’re gonna redo the concept after Eleanor cracks it, and in other moments from the actors, the writers seem to me like they’re commenting on the new concept of the show as a whole and it’s style.
Michael acts as the new ideas man present, as Michael Schur must’ve done to TV execs when the concept was presented. I think there’s more here as well about the new style of the shows serial narrative and abstract sitcom style 
Either someone’s already noticed this or I’m just going full Chidi, as of course the complete opposite might be true.

Little things i noticed from Season 1 episode 1/2,"I'm not subscribed to the subreddit because I'm watching with a friend and just started season 2, so no spoilers please! But I went back and watched episode 1/2 more closely and noticed a few things I didn't the first time around. 

1. Why is eating a sandwich +1.04 points? If you eat 3857 sandwiches, it balances out with poisoning a river lol
2. Along the same lines, Lincoln could have poisoned 200 rivers and it would have balanced out with him ending slavery in the US. 
3. After the welcome movie, when Michael is walking with Eleanor, some flowers bloom only as they enter Michael and Eleanor's line of sight. I suppose this is some faux Good Place stuff that allows you to see flowers bloom in real time. 
4. When Eleanor wakes up after the party and sees giant animals, etc. and she says ""Motherforker,"" a giant fork immediately plummets from the sky. 
5. Eleanor has a Michigan Law t-shirt, presumably where ""real"" Eleanor went to school. 
6. When everyone has those blue and yellow outfits, everyone's shoes are one solid color- either blue or yellow, but Janet's is striped blue and yellow.
7. There is a clown costume next to Chidi's chalkboard in this episode. 
8. When Eleanor says ""I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day. Have fun, nerds,"" the woman behind them makes a confused face, as if she overhears and is like ""huh, someone like this is in the good place?""
9. ""You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is."" -Tahani

The Good Place Theory: Michael is the same spieces as the immortal beings in the real good place,"I just finished seasons 1 and 2, and I have an interesting theory about Michael's origin. Idk if it's implied, or just really bad, but here goes.

We've all been wondering why Michael is able to connect to other humans that which the other demons from the bad place could not. My theory is that Michael is the same spieces as the beings from the good place, which is why he can feel empathy. I think he was placed in the wrong dimension (the bad place) upon the creation of the universe, much like how Eleanor was bad but ended up in the good place (although we know in the end it's not the good place from the start). Or perhaps everyone from the bad place and good place are the same spieces, but the good place beings are different because they hang out with humans, whereas the bad place beings don't, allowing them to be unable to feel empathy.

It may make more development and understanding for Michael in season 3, and obviously, as seen in season 1, the most outlandish twists may actually happen.",TheGoodPlace,1532878328,eric_ji7,18,89,True,False,False,True,2018-07-29

In the Dress Bitch flashbacks, obnoxious roommate Madison says she's on her way to pick up her personalized license plate at the DMV, and later, the Bad Place crowd mentions that they want to get back to the Bad Place in time to watch ""The Bachelor"".

Has anyone addressed this yet?,"So I’ve looked everywhere and can’t find an answer, so I literally made a reddit account just to see if anyone knows the answer.

In season 1 episode 1 of the good place, Chidi is introduced to us as a Frenchman of African Descent, and due to how the good place works, he understands everything everyone else says because it is automatically translated to him, and visa versa.

If you haven’t watched all of season 2, stop reading.

Then I’m the final episode of Season 2, Eleanor (with Michael’s ‘influence’) goes to see Chidi in what is suggested to be ‘real life’ as if they had not died, in order to see if they would/could become decent human beings.

So, having understood that, why can she then talk to him/do we hear his American voice, if he is French/African...? It’s been bugging me, surely they wouldn’t understand each other at all? Or he would have an accent?

My Good Place theory,"Okay, here's what I think (and I promise I'm not trying to be a dick towards any of the creators of the really imaginative theories out there).

I think that everything is exactly as it seems.  I think that Michael is a demon, not an angel, but also that he's not going to turn on them.  I think that Chidi, Tahani, and Jason are not secretly demons who are testing Eleanor.  At this point in the story, I think that everyone is exactly who and where they appear to be.

And here's why.  Mike Schur, and the other writers on TGP, are amazing writers, I think we can all agree.  And amazing writers know that you can really only drop a huge twist on your audience once before you lose their trust and they stop just watching and enjoying the show, and start spending the whole time trying to figure out how you're fucking with them.  Nothing Mike Schur has created in the past has led me to believe he's the kind of writer who just enjoys messing with his audience's heads.  He enjoys telling a story that has us all feeling good at the end.  

Michael's not going to turn on Eleanor, Tahani, Jason, and Chidi because he's already done that once, and it would be crummy writing if he did it again.  Human characters aren't going to turn out to be secretly demons, because they've already done that once, and... again, crummy writing to repeat it.  

I truly believe that we don't have any other giant twists coming our way because I believe that the writers of this show are too good at what they do to need another one.  ",TheGoodPlace,1532963668,lhagler,37,236,True,False,False,True,2018-07-30

The Good Place Theory/Idea (Shawn's Return),"I am hard pressed to call this a theory, because it's not about a changing perspective to whats been presented, but rather taking what is established and moving it in another direction (If any of that makes sense).

Just finished rewatching the series, and I thought it would be an interesting idea to keep Shawn involved. As we know, at the end of season 2 Michael locked Shawn in an unmarked room, with a never ending supply of the New Yorker. Now that Michael is behaving more ethically, I can see him feeling bad with how he left things with his old boss, but he can't simply let Shawn go either. I think it would be interesting if Michael gave Shawn recordings (or reports) of all the reboots for him to observe. Being who/what he is, Shawn can probably absorb the info from the 800+ reboots relatively fast. Shawn decides what Michael decided, that the system is fundamentally flawed, and helps to become part of the fix for the system.

This could be followed by Team Cockroach having to help rebuild The Bad Place, and deciding where people go on a case by case basis (Tons of Ethical dilemma's for Chidi). All this will of course happen after their new test, though Michael could give Shawn those reports during the test, while everyone is on earth (giving him time to process them).

This was really just a thought experiment. I am trying to work out where the show is going, because no matter what the results are of this new test, I don't see the team ending up in the Good Place (since that is the final goal that will probably be accomplished in the final season, unless the Good Place is fundamentally broken). This will have them working with their former tormentors, and a pretty rocky foundation (the demons will not be happy about any of this). 

A major problem with this that I will admit to is that Michael cannot just walk around the bad place anymore, so reaching Shawn would be difficult (though maybe not for Janet). In anycase, I thought this would be fun. What do you guys think?",TheGoodPlace,1532979811,TiniroX,4,15,True,False,False,True,2018-07-30

Just finished season 2 for the first time,"What if we have not yet seen the good or bad places, and the whole journey so far hasn't been about determining the innate goodness or badness of the characters, but about them figuring out what their ideal afterlife would be? The one thing they all have in common is that they have zero self-awareness, none of them except Eleanor even understood why they were in the bad place at first. Would they have appreciated a paradise where their every whim was catered to? Chidi wouldn't be able to choose what his idea of perfect was, Tahani's idea of perfect would be meaningless without her sister and parent's approval to win, and Eleanor would have considered everything dumb if she had to share it with anyone else, but be miserable alone. 

The Good Place so far has been about the characters determining for themselves what their good place looks like and whether they are worthy of it - not based on arbitrarily assigned values of good or bad but based upon whether they would actually be able to appreciate a good place if they had one.",TheGoodPlace,1533114218,Demonikjosh,10,18,True,False,False,True,2018-08-01

Question about Janet in season 2....,"I thought her retrieval abilities such as grabbing a water couldn’t work outside the neighborhood. Currently rewatching watching S2 E10 and they are on their way to the “real bad place” in disguise on the train.

I remember a moment while on the way to the medium place when Janet said on the train her powers didn’t work outside the neighborhood.

Extended Cuts Online,Hi there. I’m catching up on season 2 (currently on episode 7) and noticed that the NBC streaming service shows all episodes as “extended cuts”. Is there any significant changes from the televised versions I’ve missed?

Theory about the real good place,"So, I've been thinking what I would do if I was in the good place and to be honest, I'd be a bit of a scum bag... there are no consequences after all. Therefore I could imagine that if the gang ever gets to the actual good place, (some) people there will have turned into awful human beings. They could then maybe use this to argue that behaviour on earth shouldn't be the only indication of whether someone is good or bad and maybe convince the judge to take their progress after life into consideration. 

One of the arguments of the judge was that Eleanor has only improved because she wants to get to the good place. But wouldn't the same be true for most, if not all, people on earth? They are good because they want to get to heaven or they are scared of the consequences. Then once they get to the good place, they are faced with a system where there are no consequences, they can't die because they are already dead, they can't get arrested and no one is watching anymore. And at the same time they can simply ask Janet for cocaine at any time, for example... Plus, if everything is always great, people are bound to get bored. And boredom leads to stupidity in many cases. I know I wouldn't be as careful not to mess up in that situation as I was on earth...",TheGoodPlace,1533378875,SabrinasLittleSister,11,12,True,False,False,True,2018-08-04

The thing is that there's a nice person in Jason somewhere, but he's  just so... damn stupid!

(Possible Good Place Plot Hole) What is Chidi's Language?,"One major question and possible plot hole of the good place. In episode 1, Chidi tells Eleanor he is actually speaking French.

[Discussion] Was The Good Place inspired by The Invention of Lying?,"I just watched Ricky Gervais' The Invention of Lying made in 2009, and I noticed a lot of similarities between this movie and The Good Place.

Hmmm... I just caught something,"In season 1 episode 12 Shawn says he had been ""asleep in goo for 29 years"" before Elenor's trial. However, in the next episode and in season 2, we see him awake and part of the process of approving Michael's fake Good Place idea - which, if the timeline is straight forward, would not have been close to 29 years before season 1 begins.

Does this suggest that the crew are not the first to go through the fake Good Place after all, or that the beginning of season 1 is not actually the first run of the fake neighborhood? Or is it an oversight?",TheGoodPlace,1533697190,freckleupagus,3,7,True,False,False,True,2018-08-07
My season 3 theory take,"Just some thoughts on what I've picked up so far. There was I think a tvline interview? That I got these clues from:

* It won't take long to get everyone together, so the point of season 3 will be the four together
* New character being played by a new actor, being described as ""sort of a doorman""
* We will ""know immediately what they're trying to do with the season"" by the end of the first or second episode, so it'll probably be a familiar format

My guess is that Season 3 is gonna take the format and idea of a roommates/apartment sitcom like Frasier, Friends, Seinfield, New Girl, etc. It's an immediately recognizable sitcom trope that would definitely give us the feeling of ""ok yup i know exactly what they're trying to do"", it would obviously have a doorman character work very well, and it would be an arrangement that would be very easy to stably get everyone back together at the start of the season.

So my question is... in the season finale, we find out they are in the bad place after all.... this leads me to wonder, is the medium place real or was it all a part of the good place facade? And if so, does that mean Janet was in on it?

(spoilers) Eleanor's damage to the neighborhood,"I was just wondering about how the damage to the neighborhood was happening. At first we all thought that because of the glitch that brought her there, Eleanor's bad actions were corrupting the perfect neighborhood.

But knowing the final twist, either Michael was generating disasters deliberately based on her actions, or he some how created a link between her and the fabric of the neighborhood.

One noteworthy piece of information is that no harm seems to have arisen from Jason, which has two possible explanations that I can see. Either he, being silent and spending his time in his own budhole, managed to affect nothing, or Michael was not dealing with him in the same way at all.

Which makes more sense? And if Michael left Jason out of that side of his plan, why?",TheGoodPlace,1494541085,Ymir_from_Saturn,3,10,True,,False,,2017-05-11
THE GOOD PLACE: There is NO Heaven AND hell!!!,"SPOILER WARNING

(Also, just note that I've only finished watching season 1 a few hours ago and have only begun reading subreddits. I've also haven't watched Schur's interviews re: this show.)


I've been on subreddits for a while now and I see lots of theories on how Eleanor, Chidi, Jayson, and Tahani got sent to the bad place. Questioning their morality and such. And how they could reach salvation through good deeds and be sent to the Good Place.

I think most people, after watching the season one finale, have forgotten the premise that the religions were only 5% correct. Michael could well be lying about that, but I doubt it. Anyway, here are my thoughts:

Mindy is not a minion of Michael. The Medium Place is real.
Someone from another thread pointed out that Mindy died 30 years ago, and Michael only began the construction of Fake!Good Place recently. The video they watched on TV was a message from two representatives, Adam Scott and that other one who I don't think we've seen anywhere in the Fake!Good Place. (Check out: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5p0kec/episode_discussion_s01_e13_michaels_gambit/dcnz28p/)

Michael has implied before that there are dimensions humans simply cannot see/fathom. Although there is the Good Place, and there is the Bad Place. That doesn't mean those are the only places to exist in the Afterlife. Here's my theory.

Humans (normally) experience two simple dimensions/destinations: Life and the Afterlife. When people die, they transfer unto the next dimension, the Afterlife. Now, in all the dimensions, there are two powerful factions. The ""Good"" and the ""Bad"". So when people die, they don't automatically get sent to The Good Place or The Bad Place, those factions just.. get dibs on them.

I'm not sure if the point system is real, but I think they are some sort of basis for higher beings to judge a person. But that does not decide what's right or wrong. Because right and wrong, and even the truth, are subjective. Even if you say that there are opinions, and then there are hard facts... This is the truth of the universe we are talking about. People/beings cannot decide what ultimately is the truth. But I don't want to get into that debate.. 

I'm just saying that, the point system was used by Michael to further torture the four of them.

So, don't be fooled. This is very much inspired/influenced by Christianity/Catholicism. But keep an open mind to fully enjoy the show.

But what do you think?

Probably the former but if it's the later imagine the confusion in all the neighborhoods Good and Bad to such a message through the Janets.

Anyone else have incredibly mixed feelings on rewatch? SPOILERS,"Don't get me wrong, I love this show and will likely rewatch it many times. 

But man, everything is just so painful to me after the reveal. What really sucked me into the show was just how magical everything is. Yeah, there was a ton of stress for the characters due to everything Michael was doing, but like Eleanor said in the last few minutes, they really and truly made each other better. That's what I loved so much about the middle of the show. Just my kind of humor, constant high energy, great cheer, bright colors, fun, hope, laughter. 

On rewatch all of those things are still there, but indelibly stained. Deeper certainly, but also much more cruel. I thought it was brilliant that the last ep showed the truth of the marriage counseling scene; it implies that every scene was built similarly without quite explicitly saying so. It forces us to reevaluate basically every single interaction the ""extras"" ever had with the main 4 as meant to cause, even in small amounts: pain, anxiety, and general cruelty. I consider that to make this show VERY high art, but dang if it doesn't make me feel sad.

Thought dump after just having binged the good Place,"I learned about this show this morning, and just finished the first season.  I have no one to discuss the show with, so if you are bored enough you can be subject to my thoughts.

The writing, structure is outstanding.  Ted Danson's performance is seriously impressive.  Loved Michael as a character, until the twist.  Kinda sad his character is kinda gone forever now, as a neurotic angel with faults he was so likeable and loveable.

The themes are great, more substantive than most TV.  I loved how they covered actual concepts, felt a bit like infotainment.  The look and feel of the world is great.   I loved how they took an absurd idea and took it seriously.  Many shows/films don't get that formula right.  Although the brimstone monster in the conference room was maybe a low point on that count.

The characters were generally good, with Janet being the real star.  The beach scene, all the social faux pas, come on!  Whoever came up with her marriage to Jason deserves a raise, she is the perfect foil to his stupidity.  

The flashback set pieces were all home runs, really flushes out the characters while universally being off the hook hilarious.  Production overall was just so good.

The twist ending was a real disappointment.  Sure, it sets up an interesting mechanic - a set of brain wiped characters have a mystery to solve.  I guess that's cool, but the twist simply ruined the whole feel of the show for me, and I'm seriously not interested in season 2.

I think I'm going to imagine that the series ended in episode 12? on the train with Janet declaring ""Ride or Die!"" before sending her, Jason and Elanor to the bad place.  That would have been the perfect ending for what up to that point was kind of a piece of narrative art.  A farce ending in tragedy.  2 undeserving souls who tried their best to earn a place in heaven, but in the end nobly sacrified themselves to spare true friends from eternal torture.  That would have put a particularly pungent cap on the show, perfectly constrasting what was up to that point a whistful, playfull look at the afterlife.  Similar to the end of the first Matrix film, at that point it felt like the character and story arcs had come to a perfect end.",TheGoodPlace,1503596136,firstpageguy,6,6,True,,False,False,2017-08-24

Something that really irks me about the finale [spoilers],"I don't understand exactly what is the deciding factor in being designated to the Good or the Bad Place. Chidi always had the best intentions, but his actions were not always entirely positive. Tahani, on the other hand, was the complete opposite; very philanthropic, inarguably good actions, but for reasons that were more selfish.

It baffles me how two complete opposites could both be destined for the same fate. Is the deciding factor in whether a person is good or not their intentions or their actions? I mean this question probably lies deeper than the show, but still would be nice to see some consistency.

And I know that this is everyone's complaint here on the subreddit, but it really baffles me that either of them are being sent to Bad Place. It's not like Chidi really ruined any lives, he may have inconvenienced some but that's it. And Tahani saved the lives of so many. No one would donate to charity if they didn't get some sort of gratification (albiet some more than others). Yes, she was a little rude at some points, but I don't think that all of those people who benefitted from her charity cared much about how much Tahani boosted her ego. Neither one deserves to be tortured forever because of it imo.

The frozen yogurt twist theory (spoilers),"Michael said something about frozen yogurt early in the season that stood out. It was something like, ""Because there's nothing more human than taking a good thing and making it slightly worse so that you can have more of it.""

It's kind of a funny line, but it feels too philosophical to just be a throwaway line. I think it's a hint. 

There isn't a good place or a bad place. There's only the human place. Everyone goes there. Humans can't actually enjoy an eternity full of constant pleasure and satisfaction because it would be too much of a good thing. They would get bored in a perfect world with no obstacles to overcome. It would be as boring for them to live in as it would be for us to watch. So the architects create a good place, but intentionally make it slightly worse so that humans can enjoy it for eternity. Kind of like TV producers who never want their series to end.

If I can play Chidi for a second, this fits with the existential idea that suffering is inherent in existence and even in pleasure. We enjoy ourselves only when striving after something we don't have, but at the same time, not having that thing brings us suffering. It's like that spiel one of Dostoevsky's characters gives about how sticking a man in a perfect world would never satisfy him. His very human nature would make him do everything he could to fork it up just for kicks. Just to assert his freedom.

So the architects create situations where humans have to continually overcome obstacles that stand in the way of the good place. But they ensure these obstacles aren't too impossible to overcome. Eleanor doesn't have to restructure society and end all wars; from her perspective, she only has to be a good person and get along with her friends in order to create paradise. It's all within her power. 

There is one more stage. Once the subject *does* overcome all obstacles, the architect is forced to reset their memories. This is because humans are not made happy by obtaining the things they want; rather it's the *striving itself*  that fulfills them. The architects then loop this process of striving and forgetting for eternity (reminiscent of Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence).

Eleanor realized in the season 1 finale, just before she was told her memory would be erased, that she had overcome every obstacle placed in her way to get to the good place. The four friends were now close enough that they could stop torturing each other. Eleanor's realization that she made it to the good place is Michael's cue to erase her memory. 

One more thing. The lava pits, spikes, and bees that Michael mentions in the office meeting are all part of the standard script for every human, which we saw play out when a lava pit opened up and chaos reined every time Eleanor did something bad. That part happens in every neighborhood. Michael's twist was just to add in the interpersonal obstacles.

Flashbacks,"1. What is everyone's favourite flashback? Mine is the Chidi's Choice where we see Chidi's horrible indecisiveness. 

2. Do we want more Earth-realm flashbacks in Season 2 or do we feel that we know these characters? According to Michael Schur the second season will be from Michael's perspective, so the Earth flashbacks will naturally become less important. http://www.indiewire.com/2017/08/the-good-place-netflix-michael-schur-twist-season-2-1201869241/",TheGoodPlace,1504139558,oncenightvaler,9,11,True,,False,True,2017-08-30
When did they die? (spoilers),"When the show first begins and all of them enter into what we believe to be ""The Good Place"", Michael's initial presentation led me to believe that everyone who enters the good place at the same time must have died on the same day and, according to their personalities, were placed in neighborhoods with personalities that suit their own. 

Now knowing what happens after, and taking into consideration the fact that Michael specifically created this version of the bad place to fit the four distinct personalities of Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason... /when/ (in the real world) did they die? I realize it's the afterlife and time doesn't really exist anymore, but it's something I've always wondered about. 

Separately, if you aren't placed into your neighborhood right after you die, do you wait until every person meant to be placed in it dies as well? If not, are yours and your soulmates lives tied together, so that you die on the same day and enter together? Do they place your soul in a 'box' until you can enter your neighborhood, similar to the ending of Black Mirror's San Junipero? 

Even as I write this question I am making myself even more confused about the timeline because I can't make any sense of it, but it's something I always wondered about as I watch the show. 

Even at the end after Eleanor's memory is cleared, she is introduced to the Good Place as if she had just died.

What if this has happened before? [spoilers],"So I finished the show on a three day Netflix binge this week, and understandably it's on my mind quite a bit, especially since season 2 is so quickly upcoming.

Just had this thought, and I'm sorry if this is not original and was touched upon months ago - what if this is a Groundhog Day type of scenario and this isn't the first time the neighborhood has been reset? What if this has happened hundreds of times? After all, this is eternity.

What would this mean for the story? Would it be too lazy and/or depressing?

""Fake Eleanor"" looks like a fruity flavor, like someone a little unconventional with real 'flavor' (imperfections/ personality). The 'theoretical third person' yogurt with the twisty flavors is Tahani, and the visual is mirrored by the multicolored braids that Eleanor gives to her.

Anyone Not Dig The Finale? [Spoilers],"So I just binged the show yesterday and from the get go I assumed that it was not really ""the good place"" and that everyone there was imperfect. I didn't think they were in our concept of hell, I just thought they were in ""a place"" and it was an experiment of sorts to see if people could be good because you told them they were good.

The actuality of it being a bad place for the four main characters specifically and everyone else being part of a Truman show type thing for the demons kind of soured things for me. It made some things in the past make less sense and it hurts the rewatch value of the first season.

All that being said things going my way would have made future seasons more like a traditional sitcom just set in the afterlife more so than the mystery thriller plot line it now has. ",TheGoodPlace,1504305034,BenjaminTalam,6,1,True,,False,True,2017-09-01

It's Limbo. All the things that made it seem like an unsatisfactory 'Good Place' (Michael's ineptitude, problems caused by tenants) are equally matched by things that make it an unsatisfactory 'Bad Place.' This is the place where Eleanor became a better person, the place where she was *happy* because she was becoming a better person. 

I believe this place is a stasis where people remain until they are worthy to go to the real 'Good Place.'

My Theory For Season 2 (Includes season 1 spoilers!),"Here's how I think the main four characters are gonna eventually figure out that they are really in the bad place. I think that it's gonna come down to Mindy St. Claire. If you think about it she is the only one (that we know about) that knows the truth. I think eventually one if not all of the main characters  is gonna find her again but not know who she is. Then one of two things will probably happen. Mindy will realize they don't know who they are and say something like ""You don't remember me?"" or Michael may have asked her to play along. Then she would have to decide if she wants to be a good person or a bad person. If she is good then she will tell them but if she works with Michael it would be different.

Mike &amp; Michael: Meta-commentary on sitcom writing,"Super late to the game, I know, but I just finished the first season. I was wondering the whole time whether it was a coincidence that Michael shares his name with the creator of the series, Mike Schur. Schur-ly not, right?

Then, at the end, it all made sense. What Michael is doing to the four protagonists is just what sitcom writers do. Each episode centers around a key conflict that needs to be resolved, and then in the next episode there's another, and then another. So a sitcom writer is essentially an omniscient and omnipotent being who designs a world of eternal, cyclical conflict for a perfectly chosen cast of flawed and clueless inhabitants.

An idea about Michael,"What if Michael is a ""double agent"" from the Good Place? 

Maybe after the issue with Mindy, some people in the Good Place thought there should be a place where people could come to the afterlife and redeem themselves but the Bad Place rejected the idea. They couldn't experiment with the idea in the Good Place because they couldn't get ""bad"" people there... so they had to figure out a way to do it in the Bad Place.  Insert Michael who is sent from the Good Place to the Bad Place (with a Janet) to become an architect and conduct the experiment. The problem with version 1 was that all four didn't redeem themselves before they discovered the secret. The reason Michael was so desperate for another chance was because he really is trying to save them and needed another chance for the experiment to succeed.

This could be a lot of fun as Michael would need to keep everyone in the dark, including his boss and co-workers, trying to convince them what he's doing is diabolical but also trying to nudge Eleanor and company towards redemption. It would also make a great surprise ending to the second season.",TheGoodPlace,1504728534,WildEndeavor,3,10,True,,False,True,2017-09-06

My problem with Eleanor (spoilers all),"As we learn from the final episode, Michael has concocted this neighborhood as a torture for the four leads. However, Eleanor has managed to inadvertently thwart his plans by confessing mid-season, which the show justifies her doing by saying she's learned from Chidi's lessons and example to be more ethical/considerate. She's grown. 

However, I believe that the Eleanor of the Good Place is completely inconsistent with Earth Eleanor. Her growth begins as a result of a decision that Earth Eleanor would've never made: trusting Chidi with the knowledge that she doesn't belong there.

What we learn about Eleanor through flashbacks is that her parents completely ignored her, to the point of willingly emancipating her. Other flashbacks show Eleanor aggressively pushing potential friends away - it is clear that Eleanor's experience with her parents has taught her not to get close to anyone, as then she won't be disappointed or hurt when they fail her, like her parents. Eleanor pushes everyone away.

Why then, merely moments after meeting Chidi, would Eleanor ask him:

ELEANOR: ""Chidi. If you are my soulmate, that means that you would never hurt me, for any reason?""

CHIDI: ""Of course not!""

ELEANOR: ""Promise me. Say, “I promise I will never betray you.”

He agrees, and she confesses. 

This is absolutely out of character. We're supposed to believe that Eleanor spends her entire life pushing people away - horribly, blatantly, vulgarly - because she's afraid they'll betray her like her parents. Then, she gets to ""heaven,"" realizes she should be sent to hell, and immediately decides to trust a stranger with that knowledge, instead of keeping it to herself? She actively exposes herself to betrayal after a lifetime of vigorously avoiding any chance of being betrayed?

That is just unbelievable. 

That decision is, unfortunately, a HUGE one for the show. It is what prompts her to take lessons with Chidi, leading to her redemption by confessing, the foiling of Michael's plan, and them all having their memories wiped. 

What's worse, the moment her memory is wiped, she attempts to repeat the same behavior with Chris the Mailman, asking if he will betray her. We can't even argue that she and Chidi have some deep, cosmic connection justifying her confiding in him. She was gonna tell whoever she was matched with. 

This inconsistency is a huge one, and makes it hard for me to enjoy Eleanor as a character. She is so comically mean in flashbacks, but normally cynical in the Good Place. She is purposely vulgar and nasty on Earth, but suddenly has a conscience in heaven. The two don't read like the same person. And that makes it difficult to invest in her redemption, or just understand who she is supposed to be. ",TheGoodPlace,1504851288,mike8787,11,15,True,,False,True,2017-09-08
Crazy Fan Theory,"Michael works in/is from the ACTUAL Bad Place. What if the series arc is that he was someone who was sent to The Bad Place whose punishment for eternity is to endlessly make a perfect FAKE Good Place (with Elanor, Chidi, etc.) where, in his words, they torture each other and themselves; he has no need to do it himself.

Elanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani aren't actually real; they have fake origin stories given to Michael. However, they become self-aware that they are part of something not real, and begin to express free will, shown at the end of the first season.

Glenn / Michael Theory,"I don't think I've seen this theory mentioned here before, so here goes. 



**Has anyone noticed that Michael and Glenn hate each other?**



It seems to me that just about every interaction between them belies this, and since next season will focus more on Michael's perspective than on our fighting foursome, we can probably expect to see this play out even more.



There may be additional pieces of evidence to support this, but here are the big three I found:


    
* When our crew sits down to eat at The Good Plates restaurant, Michael asks if anyone wants to share the story of their favorite meal. Glenn immediately volunteers, eliciting a sour look from Michael.


    
* In the final episode, we see a flashback of Michael proposing his plan (just before the entrance of the lava monster). Note Glenn sitting at the middle right of the conference table. The other three at the table are smiling, at least a little. Glenn, by contrast, looks bored and/or disdainful. When Michael mentions ""the lightning that tears off [bad people's] flesh,"" Glenn reacts by rolling his eyes and deepening his judgmental look.


    
* In *The Eternal Shriek,* when Michael says that he soon won't be around, Glenn happily explains, ""because of the eternal shriek!"", a fact that no one's in danger of forgetting, and which no polite individual would feel the need to shout.



* Tahani is upset by this (which is perhaps Glenn's intention?), but we also see Michael purse his lips and look away from Glenn's direction after this outburst. He then briefly glowers in a sinister-enough way before, upon being addressed by Tahani, startling back to his 'good guy' persona.




Whenever the spotlight's on Michael, Glen seems to try to insert himself. 
Why?



Maybe he felt upstaged by Michael's plan? Maybe he's just old school and doesn't support this new gambit? Maybe it's a case of a longstanding rivalry? 



Whatever the cause, there's some lost love between these two, and I hope we see more of it in the upcoming season.







~~ Bonus items I just noticed on this watch through~~


* It's been suggested (and possibly hinted at by the creators?) that the Medium Place was supposed to be a real place, and actually out of the Bad Place's control. I haven't seen anything on the show to directly contradict this.



* It's also been suggested that the final arch of the show will be a re-twist; i.e. Michael will turn out to be a ""secret agent"" from the Good Place, placed long ago in the bad place, in order to determine whether bad people can change their ""goodness"" levels after they die by helping each other. Nothing in Danson's performance would be out of place if this long scheme were true. 



* Guess who else was at that conference table during Michael's proposal? The woman (dressed identically in yellow) from the 1st episode's explanation of Good Place soulmates.",TheGoodPlace,1504911826,accidental_antilogy,7,13,True,,False,True,2017-09-08

And sure, sure, that sound nice, but it also sounds easy. We are all here because we believe there’s a better way to make humans miserable, and I, I believe in you. So, TORTURE on three.

(spoilers) The Wizard of Oz theory,"So, I'm pulling a Doug Forsette this evening in my budhole, and thought of a metaphor:

The Good Place has a lot elements of the Wizard of Freaking Oz

* Eleanore is Dorothy (lack of a Home/family stability)

* Chidi is the Cowardly Lion (lacking confidence and courage)

* Jason/Jianu is the Tin Man (lacking a brain)

* Tahani is the Straw(wo)man (lacking a heart; performing good deeds in order to fill her own neediness.)

Working together the 4 get each other closer to filling what they are seeking.

* Michael is The Wizard (You start off thinking he's this all powerful, altruistic figure, and at the end this is flipped on it's head)

Still working on this part:

* Janet as The Good Witch

* Bad Janet as The Bad Witch(?)

* Day Player Demons Neighbors as Flying Monkies, though you assumed they were munchkins

Meant to post this sooner [spoilers],"The Good Place tidbits [spoilers]

I love this show. The acting's wonderful, the set design is  just-so distinctive, but the one thing that really lures me in to watch episodes again is the show's writing. I think we can all agree, The Good Place writers are the forking shirt.

Every episode seems to have a lot of well-placed, clever details. With less than a week to go until the season two premiere, I thought it'd be fun to collect a big list of as many tidbits as we can find. I know there must be plenty I've neglected or overlooked, so if you've spotted others, please post them!

~~~

POINT-SCORING 

 -In the initial video of good/bad actions and their positive/negative impacts, ""Tell a Woman to 'Smile:' (-53.83 points)"" flashes by on the right side of the screen. 

No surprise, then, when in episode 8 and 9, Trevor twice tells Eleanor to 'smile' (1st time: ""Oh, also, you should smile more,"" as Eleanor's about to board the train; 2nd time: ""I'm still waiting on that smile,"" in Michael's office).

Other especially fun point-totaling actions from this and the next screen:

 -""Fix Broken Tricycle for Child who Loves Tricycles (+4.58)."" Directly below, ""Fix Tricycle for Child Who is Indifferent to Tricycles (+0.04)."" Pretty big point difference!

 - ""Began to Compose Social Media Post About David Bowie Dying and Then Thought 'The world doesn't need to hear my thoughts on David Bowie': (+215.89.)'"" Speaks for itself. Or rather, doesn't.

 - ""Helped Mom with her Printer (x339): (+60.09)."" How many times have you helped your parent with theirs? 

and 

 - ""Attended Cousin's Friend's Child's Jazz Dance Recital: (+27.04)."" So much unrelatedness.


~~~

**Other small, easy-to-miss consistencies**:

 - At the beginning of episode three, Michael bans flying, citing the unpleasant fact that one resident collided midair with a turkey carcass. 

Later, when Eleanor hears from residents impacted by her subterfuge, one specifically recounts the turkey incident in grievance.

 - Also in episode three, we see Michael criticizing Chidi's life's work. Just as Chidi flees the room, Michael puts a fist to his mouth to, presumably, stifle glee and, just before the shot cuts out, Michael's lip turns up at the corner in a smile. Early signs of Michael's true nature.

 ~~~

Bonus fun questions to consider:

1. In the first episode, Michael describes each resident's house as, ""a home that perfectly matches his or her's true essence."" What would yours look like?  


2. In Michael's Gambit, Michael claims he can keep the four fighting a thousand years, while Sean says he thinks Michael would be lucky to last 6 months. Their reactions lead us to believe that the season's worth of time was less than 6 months, but how much time exactly do you think has passed? Weeks? Months? Do you think season two will run the same length of time?

I actually really loved how they did it, especially for a show that has moved super fast the entire first season.

A musical easter-egg at the evening gala,"!!!! SPOILER WARNING!!! 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


As I was watching the season 2 premiere, I noticed the classical music played at the evening gala was the same as in season 1 - of course this makes sense since Michael kept most things the same.

But the choice of music is probably not a coincidence - it's the aria of *Papageno* in Mozart's *Magic Flute*. Though there are only superficial thematic parallels between the show and the opera, the lyrics of the aria serve to introduce *Papageno* as a bird-catcher - telling us of his prowess of luring and caging them, how ""all the birds"" are surely his...

I guess a coincidence is possible - but the symbolic parallel between the deceptive catcher luring the bird into its cage and Michael's game is so stark, I'd be surprised if this wasn't a little easter-egg for people who listen to classical music.

What Are Your Ships?,"So this show is amazingly well-written and everything, but it also has a lot of relationship combos that work, and it knows it, so they tease ships all over the place. The ships that I'm into right now are:

Jason x Janet: The only 100% canon ship that is also perfect.

Eleanor x Chidi: This is the standard relationship of the show. It works, but I'm still not sure Chidi's even attracted to Eleanor at this point. We know she likes him, but she really doesn't seem like his type and apparently that's important to him. Still, this could work if they put more effort on Chidi's side of things.

Vicky x Chidi: Bear with me... this could work. We know she's jealous of other people that get to torture him, and she was really into her role as real Eleanor... maybe that could have translated into a sort of obsession that might become love.

Eleanor x Tahani: This is another one that seems one sided with Eleanor clearly being into Tahani despite kinda hating her and Tahani being into... mostly herself honestly. Once again, this could work if the writers put in time.

(spoilers- kinda) NBC Is doing it wrong.,"Okay, we love the show, critics love the show, but the audience isn't what it should be. I blame NBC. Here are just a few thoughts. /beginrant

Season 1. This show was set up to make you comfortable in the idea that this was a trope-y sitcom set in heaven, BUT I think the promos could have highlighted the witty, clever humor and compared it to shows like Arrested Development in order to help the audience find it.

Between 1 and 2. 

- WHY WASN'T THIS SHOW REBROADCAST DURING THE SUMMER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?! WHY!

- Why wasn't the DVD released a week or two ago? Especially to create viral buzz via special features content!

- I've seen ads on tv that give a ton away, I've heard ads on the radio that lack any pull, the @nbcgoodplace instagram person sucks and doesn't seem like they have watched the show or realize the gif/viral gold mine they have.

- The new season premiere after the finale of AGT, in theory, to catch that crowd, but I'm on the west coast at it was so late at night! 10 pm on a WEEKNIGHT!

- Now they are going to move it to Thursdays. Isn't a very [basic programming rule](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ScrewedByTheNetwork/LiveActionTV) that NBC should know by now (cough, cough, Community) is to not shuffle shows?

I'm sure (or should I say, Schur, /groan) there's more, but I need to go calm myself)

Am I the only one who disliked this last episode?,"There were so many things I didn't like.


1. The idea was to have humans torture each other, separating the only four humans does not accomplish that goal.

2. Being too heavy handed with the torture outright would tip them off very quickly.  The level of torture in this episode seemed to have been purposefully ramped up despite the discussion of a ""slow-burn.""

3. If these new demons are incompetent actors, why not use the old ones?

4. The Hawaiian pizza joke is kinda funny but with the yogurt they got to choose their yogurt, it does not make any sense that in heaven you wouldn't get your choice of pizza.  Like there are so many better things you could do

5. I can't understand from a narrative standpoint why you have the note only to essentially erase it from existence in the next episode. 


6. Nothing happened in the plot besides Michael lying to Sean.  Seriously, everything we saw for all intents and purposes didn't happen.  The only development we saw in this episode was in Michael.

It was a great source of conflict and torture for our protagonists in version 1.0 and I can't see why they still can't do it just because they all have different soul mates.,TheGoodPlace,1506090470,randomwordglorious,11,13,True,,False,True,2017-09-22

How will Michael deal with his boss and get out of this situation?,"We know Michael shouldn't even have an attempt 3. And attempt 3 is likely to fail as well.

At first I was scared of a ""Groundhog day"" season, and I hate episodes like that, let alone an entire season. But now I'm confident Mike and the gang will compromise. Michael wants to avoid destruction and the gang, well, they want to avoid hell.

Or will they fool Michael and keep him out of the loop, pretending to fall for his tricks?

I like the idea that they will reach a compromise. Michael would erase the memories of everyone else working there, except Janet and Denise, and they would have to convince them that they're actually people from Earth who died and went to the Good Place, but somehow lost their memories.

Does that make sense?

"Finished Season 1 Last Night, and a throwaway line puzzled me... [SPOILERS] [SPECULATION]","So I went into this show knowing the finale's twist.  It sucks I didn't get a chance to let the show bamboozle me, but I loved watching Ted Danson play the nice guy incredibly well (especially since Cheers is my favorite TV sitcom ever, hands down).


But to my point:  during the final episode, we see a flashback where Michael pitches The Good Place experiment to his bosses.  He quickly mentions he managed to steal a Good Janet to give his Faux Good Place an extra layer of realism.  But how easy would it be for Michael to get his hands on a Good Janet?  Is it a matter of ""hacking"" into The Good Place's mainframe &amp; downloading a good Janet, or is Janet's incubation form a tangible object which someone could conceivably steal?  Regardless, I doubt The Good Place makes mistakes very often - my guess is someone (or someones) let Michael take Janet.


But why?  Besides singlehandedly running every Good Place on their own, Janets are able to learn with every reboot.  But I can't imagine most Janets are rebooted as often as ours, making all the personality developments with our Janet uncharted territory.  


Michael also constantly tinkers with Janet's programming to give her the illusion of personality quirks and feelings.  But what if he unwittingly gave Janet the building blocks for true sentience?  By the end of season 1, Janet has verbally expressed Love (for Jason) and Hate (for walking), and even writes a failsafe protocol into her programming so she can be even more loyal to Jason.  And whether or not her Ride-or-Die protocol is still in effect in the second Good Place, the fact remains Janet learned a lot of human tendencies from Jason, good and bad.  Traits &amp; flaws like that are what make us human, and they'll likely give Janet individuality.



TL;DR - I think Michael is being manipulated by forces from The Good Place (or maybe even outright collaborating with them) to unwittingly give Janet sentience &amp; individuality.",TheGoodPlace,1506121465,girlsgoneoscarwilde,10,47,True,,False,True,2017-09-22

What does the Bad Place Tell Us About Sexuality in the Good Place?,"When watching the season premiere, I started to think about sexuality on the show after reading the thread talking about how the show is good with diversity. During the episode, I realized that every soulmate pairing on the show was in a heterosexual relationship- except for Jason, who was placed in a strictly platonic relationship with another man, which is very apt torture for a person like Jason. While Eleanor has had flirtations with Tahani, there have only been mandated heterosexual couplings in the Bad Place. While the Bad Place we see in the show offers a pretty small sample size- since the only people that we truly know have been subjugated to the Bad Place are Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason- it still informs us a little bit about what sexuality might be like in the Good Place. It's unlikely that the show would be going with the fundamentalist Christian ideology that the LGBTQ+ community would be placed in the Bad Place as we have not yet seen that represented in this show. So, it's entirely possible that the Good Place allows people to be with whatever partner they want. The Bad Place we are introduced to also sets things up so that the relationships are strictly monogamous, which might be something else that varies in the Good Place. However, it is worth noting that the show is based on the premise coming from Sartre's philosophy that ""Hell is other people"" and if hell is other people, then what does that make heaven? Other people might be completely removed from the Good Place and sexuality would be of little importance there. But the Bad Place informs us that monogamous, heterosexual relationships are consistent throughout this one grouping and it might be consistent throughout others too- depending on how it is deemed best fit to torture them.",TheGoodPlace,1506178826,iliveinadreamatorium,11,3,True,,False,True,2017-09-23
Spoilers Thoughts about the show so far S2E1,"When they were going to decide which two had to go to ""the bad place"" i really thought they were going to convince Jason and Janet it was like a couples get away and just have those two leave willingly. 
Also as we see in season 2, the fact that all the people being part of the community are demons/actors, I wonder if they quit their jobs from before and their section is on hold or are there like a lot of workers in the ""twisting section"". I found it weird how we don't see their real form, like we did with that lava monster. 

Is Mindy StClaire real or was she part of the  bad place actor crew.
 
I think Tahini did something really bad, raising money to prove you are a good person might be selfish but it helped people, so I don't think that's that bad of a reason for it to be an excuse to go to the bad place.

[Spoilers] Difference between demons and Dead People?,"After watching the first season, I initially thought that all of the other inhabitants of The Good Place were other dead people who were given the chance to torture the main four characters. I figured they were being tortured themselves in The Bad Place and eagerly jumped on this opportunity to torture other people because it would be better to be in a fake Good Place than the real Bad Place.

Upon rewatches and the first two episodes of Season 2, I now understand that the ""extras"" are demons, disguised as humans. How did they get to be demons? Were they always demons? Were they ever human souls that were transformed into demons after being in The Bad Place?

Is Michael a demon? Or is he a human soul who went to work for The Bad Place instead of being tortured? What about Shawn? If they are both demons, why are they in human form? We saw from Michael's flashback at the conference table all of the people there were in human form except for that fire-demon. Why is that? Are Michael and Shawn really humans in the afterlife? Shawn would have no reason to maintain his human disguise while conversing with Michael over the afterlife equivalent of FaceTime. Are the ""extras"" in the neighborhood not really humans?

Yet another Theory (Are we sick of these yet?),"Whatever Michael does, Eleanor will figure it out. The only way forward is for Michael to accept that and work it into the plan. Therefore Michael needs to let Eleanor in on ""The Good Place"" and get her to work for him before she blurts it out to the others.

Based on the names of future episodes listed [here](https://www.tvtime.com/en/show/311711/episode/6141747) (Thanks /u/MadDoctor5813 for that link.) I'm guessing that ep. 5 ""Existential Crisis"" has Michael breaking down and coming to the above conclusion about Eleanor with the final scene being an ""Eleanor, we need to chat"" moment. At this point he probably recognizes that spark she gets in her eyes when she's about to pull ""an Eleanor"".

Also, I should note, I'm counting the hour long premiere as ep. 1-2 whereas the site linked just counts it as ep. 1.

Ep. 6 ""The Trolley Problem"" picks up with the recruitment pitch. Basically Eleanor has the choice between helping to torture the other three herself or allowing them greater torture (butt spiders and penis flatteners) at the hands of someone else. The kicker will be that she herself will be tortured as well if she refuses to cooperate but that motivation will fade in importance by the end of the season.

Ep. 7 ""Janet and Michael"" could be a flashback episode about Michael stealing Janet from a real good place, but I think it'll actually be about Michael needing a confidant of some sorts and Janet is as close to neutral as he can find. He still needs to torture Eleanor so he'll have to work that into how he forces her to torture the others. The other demons can't know that she's in on it so he has no allies there. Janet, although seemingly more aligned with the humans and Jason in particular, may be obligated to follow direct orders from Michael, him being the architect of her domain.

Past that, I've got nothing; best I can tell from the remaining show titles, a burrito is somehow important. Although, the ep. 13 title ""Somewhere Else"" has me itching to find out where this goes.",TheGoodPlace,1506223278,snowywind,4,11,True,,False,True,2017-09-23

Is the point system even real? [Spoiler],"This is something that just occurred to me. I could very well be reading too far into things, but here goes: do we actually know for sure that the morality point system seen throughout the show is the actual method used to determine whether humans go to the Good or Bad place? I believe it's possible that the concept of the points method is something Micheal invented as yet another way of torturing the humans.


The most example is Tahani, who for a while is horrified with her ""low"" ranking in comparison to the other residents of the neighborhood. Since we know the other residents are really just actors and as such wouldn't have morality scores even if the system IS real, it's safe to say that Micheal intended for Tahani to find those scores - why else would they exist? It also explains why he would leave such critical information just lying around. Admittedly, while this shows that the scores everyone has have definitely been faked, it doesn't *necessarily* prove that the points system itself is fake, as there could be ""real"" scores out there somewhere. 
It affects other characters too. For Eleanor, it's held over her head as a way of categorically proving that she's just *terrible*. In the finale, she has a line about how this must be her hell because she's surrounded by people who are much better than her, which the points system reinforces. When it comes to Chidi, this is just speculation on my part as I don't think there are any specific examples in the show, but you just *know* that as a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, he must be having a a lot of sleepless nights grappling with the fact that human morality is dictated by a purely binary good/bad points system.


A couple of possible arguments against this theory spring to mind for me: first, we see an actual points counter in the show, towards the end when Eleanor is trying to prove she's earned her right to stay in the good place. Now, Micheal could just be using it to taunt the humans with the fact that nothing they do seems to make it go up, but the fact that it suddenly jumps up when Eleanor decides to surrender herself to the bad place (which I don't think Micheal was expecting?) would imply that the point system is actually fully functional and is tracking Eleanor's actions, and not just something Micheal was controlling manually to torture the gang with. The other problem is that while in the Medium Place, Eleanor mentions the point system and Mindy seems to know what it is, implying it really is the system used. However, this one can be chalked down to Mindy simply assuming Eleanor was using a figure of speech in her line about whether or not Mindy should get the points for her actions. Also, both of these issues can be explained if you believe that the Medium Place was also part of Micheal's elaborate setup and that he planned the whole thing, though I, for the record, do not.


Anyway, if anybody's still reading this, that's my theory on the points system! I'd love to hear what you guys think!",TheGoodPlace,1506300152,WifiLlama,15,18,True,,False,True,2017-09-24

Not that it was his intention to be a prank show but at the next afterlife Emmy's he'll be smiling and taking credit while executive producer Shawn will be gritting his teeth accepting the awards the show garners. This will create a barrage of new afterlife bad place entertainments made in Michael's newer avant-garde style.  The Core Four will either go on for eternity entertaining, or more likely, inevitably replaced with new victims when the audience grows bored with them.

Alcohol's effects in The Good Place (S2E1&amp;2 spoilers),"In Version 1 of ""The Good Place"", Eleanor was unable to get drunk at the party on the first night because alcohol's effects were turned off by default. She had to ask Janet to figure out how to get drunk.

In Version 2, we find out that it's Michael's plan to get Eleanor drunk, and Tahani ends up getting drunk instead. At no point do we see either character asking Janet about how to get drunk.

This brings up a couple of interesting inconsistencies between the two versions. I'm not sure if it's just an oversight in writing, or it actually indicates a difference in the way that the party in each version was planned.

Questions worth considering:

1. Was it Michael's plan for Eleanor to get drunk in Version 1?

2. If so, why did he leave it up to Eleanor to ask Janet how to get drunk? Wouldn't it have been much safer to just allow her to get drunk by default?

3. If it wasn't Michael's plan, was the idea of a Chaos Sequence improvised?

4. In Version 2, were alcohol's effects enabled by default?

5. If not, how did Tahani get drunk? Did she ask Janet just like Eleanor did in Version 1?",TheGoodPlace,1506445410,sudifirjfhfjvicodke,21,18,True,,False,True,2017-09-26
Yet another theory! (long),"I just finished season 1 on Netflix, and I am so impressed with the show! I've been thinking about some things, and have a few theories, that may or may not be true.

1. I LOVE Trevor. He's probably one of my favorite characters, and I'm not so sure he's part of the Bad Place. I did read the earlier post 8 months ago about a Trevor theory, and I think the poster was on the right track.  I kind of am beginning to suspect Trevor (and possibly his crew) is way better than he appears. He says some genuinely nice things to Eleanor, especially about how he likes her smile multiple times. It wasn't done in sleazy, creepy dude way either. He also sat and pretty much gave her psychotherapy, trying to get her to leave, while they were drinking at the bar. Also, he ASKED her whether she would sleep with him. I can't see a demon asking.  It seems like he has flashes of 'niceness"" like Michael has flashes of ""evilness"" that aren't obvious until watching the season again.

  His crew, while doing karaoke, literally did not SAY the words that were on the screen.  Isn't that the point of karaoke? To literally say what's on the screen?  They just mouthed them while making mean faces. Like they were pretending. And I'll be damned myself if a demon doesn't know  how to tap a keg. They've never drank in their unlives. They're also snorting TIME???  They've never done drugs before either. They are the most awkward demons I've ever seen. It's like they're pretending to be bad and emulating the brattiest teenagers they could find. I'm not sure if Trevor might not be a rival Bad Place architect, but I'm beginning to wonder, since they're all so INEPT at being bad.

2. I don't believe Michael for a moment when he tells Tahani that she has nothing left to prove after she dies. Michael lies CONSTANTLY.  Of course he doesn't want her to improve! I'm also of the opinion that the point system is shows how BAD someone is, not how good.  Tahani is at the bottom because, really, the only things she did wrong were her motivation and her pride about how she was better than everyone else.  Jason/Jianyu is definitely the worst of the lot and highest on the list, with Eleanor close behind.  I do wonder how Glenn is the best of everyone in the neighborhood if I'm right, since he's a demon, right?  

My full theory is that people in the Bad Place can improve and get out of there. It's a place of rehabilitation, but of course, the demons don't want their neighborhoods depopulated and their amusement gone. They're going to prevent people from learning, by frustrating them and not letting them see any other good people. I believe that it is possible to get out, and Trevor and his crew (who may possibly be Good Place angels or the like) are interested because Eleanor is the first person EVER to have a chance at redemption. Which is why Trevor keeps telling her ""You don't belong here. You'd be happier with us.""  The reason the others don't have the same chance is because they each have to resolve their own issues, and they're not. Yet. 

3.  My wildest theory that I am just playing around with, is that Good Janet is God and Bad Janet is the devil. Religion has gotten more sophisticated over the ages, and so has Janet. And, she is in every neighborhood, Good or Bad, and is the only thing that can create objects, like a god does. I think she was there at the beginning of time, and both sides have disagreements on how to use her. This is pretty far fetched and I'm still working on it, so sorry!

[Spoilers S1] Flaw in Michael's plan at end of Season 1?,"Hey, tried looking at older threads and I might be mistaken, but I just watched the end of season 1 and have not yet started season 2.

So the whole ""point"" of this Bad Place is that Michael gets to make a hell where the people ""torture eachother"" and that's good and all, but then as it fails he plans to ""split them up"" and with Eleanor waking up to a new dude we're under the impression they won't meet eachother that easily, maybe ever (if all goes by Michael's plan)?

BUT, what's the point at the end of S1 anymore? 'Cause if the humans don't torture one another and they have to have all these ""workers"" there to fill in did he not just make another standard Bad Place? 'Cause these ""extras"" still have to work, but instead of performing ""classical torture"" they now have to work with this new type of torture.

Season 2 will end with Michael working together with the four to uphold the illusion that this new version of torture is working splendidly.

Unfortunately for Michael, Shawn loves the success, so he decides to expand the project by introducing more participants to be tortured under this new method.

My prediction of Michael's end game.,"From the second episode this had an uncanny felling that Michael was a little less than great, (kicking a dog into the sun then treating it like a robot and liking minions)  then when Jason was revealed i realized the formula wasn't the whole show. From there I partially predicted the twist. 
And with the focus on moral philosophy from Chidi (and finishing an into to philosophy class a a month ago) I was primed to look for more.
when Tahani's life was shown I realized the inspiration NO EXIT! By Jean-Paul Sartre! 

 in the season one Finale when they were in the room alone andEleanor said ""this is torture"" I knew I was right! 

For those uninitiated no exit is a philosophical play about 4 people in a single room in hell torturing each other. Sound familiar?  
So I believe The final form of the good place project will be Michael taking groups of 4 Putting them together and moving people around if they ask. 

This system solves everything for Michael 

Humans torture each other 
it only takes one demon for every human ever, 

 if they realize what is happening it doesn't matter,

And best of all There is literally no way to mess up, 


As I dug into this theory i started to realize this goes deeper than I  imagined,

Jason is an angel,"While watching The Good Place for the third time, my friend and I started to notice something peculiar about Jason. He's never tortured. His tortures are not tortures, they're inconveniences.

Jason places his hand on Michael twice in the show and it actually helps. There's no reason for Michael to be gas-lighting Jason about this, so what if it's actually working to calm him down?

When Jason is ""trying"" to have sex with Janet, he's off screen. He's off screen a lot actually. Even in version 2 of The Good Place, he needs to get away from his ""best friend"" to report back in to his boss.

So what brought him here? well, it's one small tiny thing that Michael said - they _stole_ the Janet and that drew the attention of the angels. So, they sent one who is pretending to be dumb.

Every time he has said or done something stupid, he has ended up pushing Eleanor to make a moral choice and she has always chosen to do the right thing.

So then let's analyse the trip to the middle place. Eleanor goes with Janet and Jason. Jason was at first not going to go he attempted to leave, but Eleanor was the one that insisted she wanted to go.

When there, she realised she didn't want to be there after all, she was better than this and needed to face the music. If you watch when they are leaving for the middle place it's Jason and Janet at the controls. Jason is telling Janet where to take them.

On the way back, Janet waits for Jason to give the go ahead for them to return. Jason is playing Eleanor and he made sure was choosing the moral path before letting them go back. He was testing her.

The Good Place experiment isn't just failing because it was a bad idea, it's failing because it's proving that the people currently going to the bad place can become better and now Jason has to stay and see how it turns out.

I believe that like others have suggested, version 3 will end in a mess once more as the season progresses the demons will start learning morality from our heroes and Michael will have to keep the charade going to avoid getting destroyed.

Jason will have to step in and save him and The Good Place from destruction because it will have truly become a good place, a new kind of middle place where lost souls can rehabilitate.",TheGoodPlace,1506593778,willowless,17,64,True,,False,True,2017-09-28

Janet's memory,"So it seems pretty obvious that every time Janet gets rebooted, she loses her memory of the previous Bad Place iterations. If it were just a matter of her having the information but not being able/knowing to share it unless directly asked, we'd expect her to remember her marriage with Jason, etc. (Sidenote: I'm so curious whether they hooked up in any of the hundreds upon hundreds of reboots. You'd think so, right?)

But when Janet gets rebooted mid-season one, did she forget everything that had happened in the previous episodes? I'm having a hard time recalling any proof in either direction. Obviously, the whole notion of Janet being ""all knowing"" is fuzzy. Like Michael, she seems aware of everything about all four humans while they were alive, yet she needs to be told Jason isn't actually Jianyu. (Which--since Jianyu wasn't a real person, where is her information on *his* life coming from? Actually, since Janet ""knew"" both Jianyu's and ""Good Eleanor's"" favorite meals in s1, she seems to have fake knowledge alongside all her *real* knowledge without...knowing it.)

Also, remember how long it took Janet to remember her ABJanets? She doesn't seem to have that problem this season. Is that a kink that gets worked out the more she gets rebooted, or are there long gaps between Michael snapping his fingers and welcoming the characters to another attempt? (There would have to be, right, because otherwise he has no time to make tweaks.)

Just wondering what other people think about this.

Let's Have Some Fun...,"Probably like many of you, I really admire Michael Schur's writing abilities.  After watching Parks and Rec, it quickly became my all-time favorite show before even finishing it.  Then I began The Office, which I also love dearly, but Michael Schur's double-duty as a writer and Dwight's cousin Mose began to really solidify my admiration for the man.  And the Good Place began to take it up a notch even before the big reveal.  I mean, this man created a show about government that didn't get overtly political, and now a show about the afterlife where I'm not being talked down to about religion.  Any lesser showrunner would have royally forked both of those concepts up.   (Side note: Sadly, I have yet to begin Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  Didn't realize it was Schur until after I began TGP, but now it's definitely high priority on my list.)

Anyway, I've been curious since the beginning of the Good Place.  Which of the Pawnee Parks Department would have ended up where?  And for the sake of discussion, the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin?  The NYPD of B99?

[Spoiler] Theory on the title The Good Place,"I think that, eventually, this place, now the Bad Place, must become the Good Place.  I think the entirety of the show will be about how growth and change must eventually transform all involved into beings worthy of a Good Place, including not just Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, but also Michael and all of the people (demons?) who work for him.  I think this idea of using people to torture each other has happened before, perhaps since time immemorial, and the powers that be, whatever they are, let it happen because it leads to change, transformation, and redemption.  It’s like eternal group therapy that everyone involved doesn’t know they’re in.

""Do you have anything I could snort, like a crushed up aspirin, or some eye shadow or cocaine?""

""Sometimes you go back because you walk in on me masturbating, and sometimes you go back because I walk in on you while I'm masturbating.""

""Did you bring the cocaine I asked for? Please tell me you remembered this time. Mama needs her medicine.""

""Oh that's real baby! That's real nastaaaaayyyyy."" 

""I cut a little hole in my wall so I could tape ya. I call it my lookin' hole.""

""See after I watch the porno I made, starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down. It's like 'anti-porn'.""

Eleanor takes her sex tape.

Languages in the good place (Spoilers?),"I've been thinking about this a bit, and wanted some other opinions on this, as I'm rewatching the show with my flatmates who haven't seen it and this struck me as odd the other day.

So we know that Chidi speaks French, as he states in S1E1. However, we also know that he speaks absolutely perfect, unaccented English, as shown when he is working as a philosophy professor in Sydney. Despite this, he chooses to speak French in The Good Place, and presumably in all permutations thereof. Does he choose this because it his native tongue, or is it predetermined by the good place?

Similarly, we know that Tahani was born in Pakistan. This means that she may speak both Urdu and English, both the national languages of Pakistan, and as her parents are presumably from Pakistan, Urdu may even have been her first language (though she was schooled in London). Do we know if she actually speaks English or Urdu in the Good Place? Moreover, if she is speaking Urdu, does the Good Place simply know how to translate that into British English, accent and all?

"Does the existence of the ""Even Worse Place"" weaken the narrative a bit?","If Chidi, Tahani, Jason and Eleanor are supposed to be tortured for eternity, then ""The Good Place"" is a really great deal.

What did the four do that got them such a great deal? It's never addressed. 

If the true Bad Place was actually just hanging around with a bunch of douche bags all day, then it would make sense that Michael would want to do something different. But from what we understand, the Bad Place is a classic Hell with unending torture. How could Michael justify wanting to do things SO differently? 

He gives the humans unlimited food, information, clothes, etc. Tahani's living like a princess. They may not be happy but they're certainly never shown as miserable.

OR, on that note, it seems that there are no negative consequences to murdering Janet, other than her losing her memory.

Let's guess what happens next (spoiler),"I know the writers are light years ahead of us and they burn out storylines at a speed like there is no tomorrow, but it will still be fun guessing what happens next. We already know that they will probably team up with Mike. 

My guess:

1. The four main characters have meetings with Mike secretly about how to fool the demon crew together and they write their own torture plot. They have fun with it (it is going to be hilarious), but their feelings get hurt sometimes like Eleanor and Childi would probably pretend to fight each other and say mean things. 

2. Shawn comes to this neighborhood to see whether Mike's plan is working out as promised. The four will pull this off, but some crew demons might find out that they are acting (Vicki, some other people). They might have to kidnap him/her to prevent whistleblowing. The crew would start to become suspicious of them. It gets harder and harder to cover up. 

3. We will probably see some previous reboot flash-back. Some of them will be hilarious, and some will be super touching (like how Eleanor and Chidi end up falling in love with each other time and time again). You caught me. Yes, I ship the two. Big Time. 

4. In the process of working with Micheal, they find out more about the real rules of the good and bad place and probably figure out a way out of this nightmare situation (stuck in the bad place colluding with Mike to avoid memory erasing).

5. Eleanor finds some weakness of Shawn and uses that to blackmail/negotiate with him. She will probably offer to sacrifice herself to save the other three (like the end of season 1). The three go to the medium place with memory wiped. Mike keeps his job. Eleanor stays in the bad place experiment with the memory of what happened.

The show's rules of the afterlife are (almost) the best,"Imagine that the rules of the afterlife described in the first episode of the Good Place are a doctrine of a religion that actually exists. I argue that a very similar model would be the most effective system for discouraging people from committing immoral actions. Why?

Let’s compare some models of the afterlife to see how the Good Place model is more effective than the alternatives. I assume that the following is true for every model:

- There’s a predefined set of moral and immoral actions that everybody is judged on after they die. Their actions determine whether they end up in a Good or a Bad place.
- The afterlife last forever, i.e. it’s not the case that people “live” in the afterlife for a limited amount of time and then cease to exist.
- Only actions are important, not their motivations – this assumption is in place to keep it simple.
- How the afterlife works is known to people during their life.

Let’s go through the models of the afterlife to see what their problems are:

*Model 1: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place forever and are not offset by moral actions*

In this model, there’s a fixed threshold of immoral actions and if you exceed it, you go to the Bad Place forever. It doesn’t matter how many moral actions you committed. If you don’t exceed the threshold, you go to the Good Place.

The problem with this model is that the person who already exceeded the threshold is free to be as immoral as they want because there’s nothing they can do avoid going to the Bad Place.

*Model 2: Duration of your stay in the Bad Place is limited*

This is similar to the idea of the Purgatory – grave sinners go to Hell but most “medium” people spend some time being punished for their limited amount of sins in the Purgatory and then get to spend the rest of eternity in the Good Place.

The problem with temporarily limited punishment is obvious: Even if the punishment lasts extremely long time from our mortal perspective (e.g. you’re punished for 10 billion years), it’s nothing compared to infinite amount of time you get to spend in the Good Place afterwards.

So this model doesn’t really discourage immoral actions at all – many people would probably conclude that it’s worth it to act immorally, suffer for a limited amount of time and then enjoy infinite amount of time in the Good Place.

*Model 3: Immoral people stay in the Bad Place forever but severity of their suffering is proportional to their immoral actions*

This is similar to the idea of a “Medium Place” in the show or to the first circle of Hell in Dante’s Divine Commedy reserved for virtuous pagans. In this model, the more immoral you are, the more severely you’re punished in the afterlife.

The problem with this model is that it encourages mediocrity. Given how difficult it usually is to act perfectly morally, a lot of people would probably settle for living somewhat immoral lives and then spending their afterlife in less than perfect conditions.

We can do better than that.

*Model 4: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place but it’s possible to erase their effects*

This is similar to a lot of Christian models – sinners are send to Hell, but it’s possible to erase effects of your sins during life in some way, e.g. by asking for forgiveness or by buying indulgences.

The obvious problem with this system is that a lot of people will act immorally because they know they can get rid of effects of their actions later. There are many examples of this in the history of Christianity, e.g. priests often asked for preemptive forgiveness for soldiers before battles so that the soldiers could go on and kill their enemies and not end up in Hell after they’re killed themselves. 

Moreover, the idea that even extremely immoral people who ask for forgiveness shortly before they die end up in the Good Place together with people who were not immoral at all seems very unjust.

*Model 5: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place but moral actions offset their effects*

This is essentially the model presented in the show. The problem with this is that it doesn’t really discourage people from acting immorally, it only encourages them to keep their score balanced.

In this system, a person contemplating murder could conclude that it’s ok to do it as long as they act sufficiently morally afterwards. A person who has been sufficiently moral so far might even think that they can murder freely because they can afford it.

This is how apparently a lot of Christians thought about morality in the Middle Ages – rulers often believed they can “offset” effects of their unjust wars by donating to the church. Think of Henry V in Shakespeare’s play, who built churches to “offset” negative effects of his father unjustly murdering Edward II and seizing the throne.

In the show, this problem doesn’t exist because people don’t know the model is in place so they cannot “game it”. But that violates one of our assumption – people need to know that a model is in place, because a model they don’t know about will hardly discourage them from committing immoral actions.

*Model 6: Immoral actions send you to the Bad Place, moral actions offset their effects, but people don’t know by how much*

*This is my proposed system and I would argue it’s the most efficient one* (in terms of discouraging people from committing immoral actions during life).

This is very similar to the model presented in the show with one very important difference. People know they will be judged for their actions, they know that moral actions offset immoral actions, but *they don’t know by how much*.

There’s a final score of your moral and immoral actions calculated after you die and everyone above a threshold goes to the Good Place and everyone below it goes to the Bad Place. But people don’t know what this threshold is (and therefore don’t know how difficult it is to get to the Good Place) and don’t know by how much a moral action offsets effects of an immoral action.

For example, if you commit a murder, raising 1 million dollars for charity can be more than enough to offset this, or it might not even come close to it. The point is that nobody knows, and nobody knows *on purpose*.

This fundamental uncertainty built into the model is a great motivator for people to try to commit as few immoral actions and as many moral actions as possible. It’s difficult to live completely morally. An occasional immoral action isn’t the end of the world in this model, because you can always at least try to rectify it by enough moral actions. But because you don’t know exactly how many moral actions is enough, you can “game the system” by only being sufficiently moral by save yourself from the Bad Place.

In this system, people would try to commit as many moral actions and as few immoral actions as possible all the time and there’s not loophole out of this system.

I want a portrait of Doug Forcett hanging in my office. Is that wrong?,,TheGoodPlace,1506871537,alivanis,6,31,True,,False,True,2017-10-01
My Doug Forcett Moment (spoilers,"I've long thought that show creator Michael Schur is writing more about the art, craft and politics of network sitcoms than anything else. But even before the first-season twist, I've been trying to suss out his endgame. So here's my best shot at a Doug Forcett moment.

Eleanor isn't dead. She's dreaming, specifically having recurring dreams of, or is daydreaming in, her ethics class. Which is taught by Chidi. The Good Place? It's a college campus.

Let me make some ""hide in plain sight"" observations:

1) We have no definitive proof that Eleanor has died--or, in fact that anyone has died. We don't see it. We see the set-up for Eleanor's death, but not actual deed. We never saw Jason die, either. We saw a set-up, yes, but not the actual death, either. Of Tahani, we know nothing.

2) Yes, we did see Chidi ""die,"" but in the most ridiculously comical, I-dreamed-of-this-moment way possible. Think about it: Who hasn't wanted to drop a heavy object on a professor's head?

3) One of the constants of all Michael's reboots is that Chidi is teaching a class. It's right there: No matter what else seems to happen in each attempt, we know Eleanor learns about ethics because Chidi is teaching her.

4) Literally the first shot in S1E1 is Eleanor opening her eyes. And that shot has been shown several other times in subsequent reboots. She keeps waking up from dreams (which, of course, are Michael's reboots.)

5) The Good Place looks like a college campus. Everyone is about the same age, which is the demographics of a college campus. We see no old people or children in the population. It's notable that Schur himself went to Harvard. The Good Place seems very much like a stylized sitcom version of a place like Harvard.

6) The events we've seen in the 16 episodes are all dreamlike: Ridiculously named shops, awful clowns, attacks of ridiculous wildlife, sinkholes, flying, dogs booted into the sun, old-timey trains going nowhere, parties that go ridiculously off track, lava monsters and assorted and vivid silliness. This is the stuff that dreams are made of to paraphrase Sam Spade.

7) Michael's open-air, public-square orientations? They've reminded me of something since the beginning. Find the S1 E1 of Community. The very first scene is an open-air, public-square orientation conducted by Dean Pelton of Greendale Community College. It's a cool TV trope now.

Sadly, I'm not as insightful as Doug Forcett. It occurs to me that even in this Eleanor-is-dreaming-and-this-is-college scenario, there's an alternate explanation: Michael could be the ethics teacher. See, especially, the scavenger-hunt episode of the Paper Chase where John Houseman's character teaches his students about contract law by constructing a scavenger hunt that can only be won if the students work together and write a contract. The core four could be a study group trying to ace Michael's ethics course. The Good Place may be Schur's inspired variation on Dan Harmon's Community. 

But I think, at heart, this could be the answer. Schur is a master of ensemble comedy with a single ""sit"" where diverse people interact: the local government in Pawnee (Parks &amp; Rec) or a cop house in Brooklyn (Brooklyn Nine-Nine). He honed his sitcom skills on a show about an office in Scranton (The Office). A college is a similarly perfect ""sit."" 

Or, of course, I could be wrong and, like Eleanor, everyone gets run over by a truck ... Or, for us older viewers with a darker outlook on life and ethics, Schur could be reimagining the dreamy, repeat-it-over-and-over lesson of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner.

[Spoilers]Could the middle place also be the bad place?,"I think the middle place is part of the bad place here's why:

* Considering the welcome video that portrayed Michael as good and Trevor as bad. So it's obviously a fake video, as Michael isn't good. It may be a clue that it isn't a real middle place.

* Mindy compares herself to Eleanor making Eleanor feel worse about herself. 

* They are miserable whenever they are there. 

* They get into arguments with each other.

* They always have to begrudgingly make a big decision which means going back. 

* Mindy grosses them out, and is mostly unhelpful.

* Jason couldn't figure out how to sleep with his wife

* Elanor gets freaked out by the I love you (And this pretty much forces them together very early in the show, so I think that the point was to upset her).

* They are always forced to leave. 


* Sean and Michael knew they took the train, and they know they can take the train in the future. Why would they allow them to just take the train to the middle place if they figure it out? Also if it was really a train out of the bad place, and could possibly get to the real bad place or a better place than the middle, then last thing they would want to happen is for them to get on the train.

I think that there are the same type of clues about the Good place being the bad place, as there are with the middle place. But ultimately I think that the way the bad place works, is that it is more like Dante, with various levels of hell. They all got sent to not the even worse place, and they find an better place. But ultimately they are just the various steps of hell. 

What do you think?

Anyone on the Eleanor/Chidi Ship? (Spoilers),"I know everyone is living for the Tahani/Eleanor relationship, but is anyone on the Eleanor/Chidi ship? Michael Schur shows tend to have some of my favorite relationships (Ben &amp; Leslie from Parks &amp; Rec, Pam &amp; Jim from The Office), and I'm loving the Eleanor/Chidi dynamic.

There have been a few moments over the course of the show that really stuck out to me: 

1. I loved how the first thing Eleanor thought to write down when she was about to be re-booted was ""Find Chidi."" I'm sure there are a multitude of things that she could have written down or different people she could have chosen to find, but her instinct was to find him. I remember reading an interview with D'Arcy Carden when she said that she kept all of those notes from the different takes because that had strangely affected her. 

2. I found it interesting that when the reveal occurred, Eleanor volunteered Chidi and herself to go to TBP. She was taking a risk and if she was wrong, she and Chidi would have ended up in the bad place together. I love that out of everyone she could have chosen, she chose to have them stay together.

3. When Eleanor revealed to the entire neighborhood that she wasn't supposed to be there, she did that for Chidi. In her time on earth, Eleanor was notoriously selfish. Up until that point, she did everything possible, no matter how crazy, to protect herself from being found out. But she basically threw that all away for Chidi. And I love that Chidi chose to help Eleanor in the first place and even stood up to Michael for her, despite the repercussions. 

4. I'm not convinced the points that Eleanor got for giving Chidi advice about ""Real"" Eleanor were because she gave good advice. I think they were more for her being selfless and being supportive, despite her own feelings. 

4. I love that even though they've been rebooted multiple times, they seem to find each other over and over again. 

5. And even though we didn't see the lead up to how it happened, I love that Eleanor was her most vulnerable admitting she loved him in that video. And I love that Chidi, Mr. Indecisive, was able to easily tell her he loved her back. 

Chidi and Eleanor seem to bring out the best in each other and compliment each other pretty well. Their feelings for each other are done pretty subtly (i.e. looks, glances, smiles, etc etc), but I'm really loving their unconventional, yet sweet dynamic. I think the ""I love you"" scene was huge for Eleanor's character development and I definitely want to see how these two got to that place.

"[Spoilers]So, what was michael's original plan?","Just binged S1 this weekend, and am all caught up on S2 as well. Something I've been wondering that I haven't seen addressed anywhere else (WARNING: Spoilers ahead!):


What *was* Michael's original plan? When he's pitching his ""Good Place"" to his bosses, he says he can get them to torture each other for 1000 years. Does this mean they all would continue to believe they were actually in the Good Place? What was he going to do if Eleanor had not figured it out at that moment, and they actually did pick someone to send to the Bad Place since, as Eleanor points out, they can't send them somewhere they already are? Do you think he was planning some kind of staged Deus ex Machina (heh)?

I know it all went off the rails after Eleanor confessed, and he said he was basically improvising from that point on. I'm just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what his next move would have been, had Eleanor not figured it out. Since he erases their memories every time they figure it out, he must've originally designed it to keep them in the dark about the reality of their situation, but I'm wondering if the whole *Groundhog Day* set up wouldn't be torture enough -- it's kind of *Black Mirror* -ish as well (if you've seen it, you know which episode I'm referring to.) What is his endgame, and why 1000 years? Where do they send them after that? The more traditional torture pits? I know this is all just inviting speculation, but that's a big part of what makes this show so fun.

Theory - Is Michael a Human too?,"The show is fantastic at including lines with double meaning.  There were many hints in season 1 that they were in the bad place, and if you rewatch season 1 knowing the twist those lines really stand out.

Has anyone else considered that Michael may be a human who has been convinced that he's a bad place architect, and his punishment is to continually create a neighborhood that won't work.

Each week there seems to be a twist that creates chaos for him, and in Season 2 he has to keep the secret of his failures from Sean in the same way that Elanor had to keep her secret from him.

Additionally, Sean had an interesting line in the finale of Season 1 that they've been trying to get humans to torture each other for a very long time.

He always sticks by Eleanor and the way he gazes at Eleanor when she does something right does seem romantic as the season goes on. While he initially meets ""real"" Eleanor, he has chemistry, but he expresses distress and reluctance to say he loves ""real"" Eleanor even though it wasn't even a choice. When talking to Micheal, he never even puts belief in the fact Tahani is his soul mate, but doesn't even show surprise that fake Eleanor might be.

How long have the gang been in the afterlife?,"So they have gone through 802 attempts at ""The Good Place"", lasting various lengths in days, from 128 days on attempt #3 to 43 days on the spoken word jazz attempt, to 55 days when Jason figured it out.

So what would you all guess for the total length of time that has passed on Earth since they arrived?

I know it's pure speculation. I am guessing that the instant fails were more rare than common, so maybe the average is somewhere between 43 and 128 days, probably closer to the 43 side given the 55. Let's say 50 days on average?

Which with 802 attempts means over 40,000 days or 109+ years.

Which means that conservatively, over a hundred years have passed on the Earth while Eleanor and the gang have been looping through. Possibly MUCH more.

Janet Presence means the plan could never work,"I believe the reason why none of these attempts have ever worked is Janet foils most of them. 

While Janet's memory is wiped each attempt, her knowledge is not. Janet knows everything, although she may not have specifically memories and meaning. Like someone with brain damage may lack their memories of learning the skill, but still have the skill.

We see this in several attempts. Janet is asked by Eleanor or Jason for help, and Janet interprets the question broadly and widely to get them them help they need. Eg. Bringing the 4 humans together. With Jason she was even very creative in interpreting his request, in such a way that suggested she knows exactly what he wants.

I believe some of this is because Janet, being an element of the real Good Place, has a nature that's in opposition to the the Bad Place. ",TheGoodPlace,1507231159,NeedsToShutUp,5,45,True,,False,True,2017-10-05

[Meta] Subreddit Rules,"Hey everyone.

A PSA from your friendly neighbourhood mods that we've put a few light rules in place on the Subreddit, primarily around spoilers, so please read!

We've added three simple rules:

**1) Content must be relevant to the TV show The Good Place.**

*Pretty straightforward - we'll remove content that's not about the show, or is only very mildly related.*

**2) No spoilers from the current season in titles**

*Given the nature of the end of Season 1 twist it would be hard to enforce no spoilers from any seasons, so for now we'll go with no spoilers from the current season.*

**3) Spoilers in comments must be spoiler tagged depending on context**

*If you're in a thread on a general topic where spoilers might not be expected, please spoiler tag your comments. Otherwise, it's safe to assume that comment sections may contain spoilers.*

Now that the show is on Netflix and we're getting an influx of new viewers I've gone back through the episode discussion threads from season 1 and deleted any comments that were spoilers from future episodes. There weren't many, except for [episode 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/5p0juq/episode_discussion_s01e12_mindy_st_clair/), since (AFAIK) eps 12 and 13 were played back to back so the episode 12 thread contained spoilers from the finale.

Please let us know if these rules seem sensible, or if you have any other requests for the mod team!

This show is the only show where I can say that the writers are smart enough to explain everything,"You know how in a majority of shows, you get this sense of ""oh man this plot has a few plot holes or other egregious things that could be explained...but the writers aren't smart enough to do so :c"" (me with GoT this year)

The Good Place? I watched the first seaso and loved it, but a few things irked me in a minor way. Like how convenient everything was, or how when Eleanor was trying to earn points that intention mattered, while tahanis intentions for doing the right thing were decidedly self-centered.

ALL of my minor criticisms of the show were addressed in the finale. Literally everything that has irked me suddenly made sense. It was SUPPOSED to irk me.

So when I think things while watching season 2 like ""how has Shawn not caught onto the fact that Michael is most definitely not on attempt 2"", i rememebr my problems with the first season and realize that I for once have total confidence in the writers to explain everything.

A fault in the system,"Don't know if this has been discussed before, but the system for sorting people into the good place or the bad place is flawed.

Say there was a person that lived to 100 but lived a fairly meh life, who does the occasional good thing, dies and just scrapes into the good place. And then there's somebody who died in their early 20s, who dedicates their young life to helping others but didn't live long enough to accrue enough points to get into the good place. 

The younger person probably deserves to be there more than the older one but the way the points are tallied means that they face an eternity of torture. 

I'm sure a character (possibly Chidi) says the system is infallible (or some varient). It isn't. ",TheGoodPlace,1507278534,UnityLovesRick,7,12,True,,False,True,2017-10-06
How will season two end?,"After watching last episode it hit me. At some point Michael told Shawn about rebooting and Shawn was OK with it, if Micheal could manage everything in a way that officially Shawn isn't aware of it.

Good Place is an experiment, so with every reboot, every minor change they put is giving good or bad result. Reboots should improve how this neighborhood works, even if humans keep figuring it out.

Version 3 ended after an Bad Place obelisk was introduced and it's a dead giveaway that Eleonor will figure it out like in version 1. This fact is a proof that at that point Michael wasn't concerned about another reboot.

The plan was to reboot so many times, that there would be a mutiny in demons, so Michael can team up with humans. Why? To get new research data and find a way to further improve the neighborhood.

Just think about it, there's only one critical flaw in his design. Humans keep figuring out that they are in the bad place.

So, Michael will team up with humans, he will learn with them, or to be honest he will observe how they learn and interact with each other while in class.

Then at the end of the season, there will be a big escape plan to get to a ""Good Place"", then will be trial that will prove that those humans become good enough to be in a real good place and Michael will come with them as he invented a tool to improve medium-bad people to become better persons.

But... it will be Michael and Shawn plan all along. The new Good Place will be just a torture 2.0. They will just eliminate that one design flaw. Humans will now know that they were in a bad place and they earned a good place.

Those 4 humans can even work as a ""judas horse"" for others. This new neighborhood could be populated with more humans, and Eleonor or others could serve as example of souls who escaped the bad place that was supposed to be a good place. It's really hard to justify ""We're in the Bad Place"" when there are 4 people who already been there.

Anyway, I'm just certain there will be a new neighborhood for season 3.",TheGoodPlace,1507279956,ForeignSprite,1,3,True,,False,True,2017-10-06

What the total length of time they've been in the good place might mean (SPOILERS S2 E3),"So with the confirmation we got in the latest episode that they've probably been there around 200 ish years--and going with the average length before they figured it out as 3-4 months, that's a lot of time for these ""bad people"" to learn all about ethics and bettering themselves. 

What I'm getting at is they have been ""good"" people in the bad place for longer than they were bad people when they were alive.

So if the Good Place gatekeepers were to examine points earned posthumously I think it's fair to assume that the four would be able to go to the good place and stay based on their own merit and not because of Michael helping them.

"A theory on the main characters' deaths (spoilers for ""Team Cockroach"")","Last night's episode gave us a few pieces of information that got my wheels spinning.

* Thanks to Tahani's magazine cover, we now know that Tahani's death and Eleanor's death happened at around the same time.
* All of the main characters died in freakish Final Destination-type deaths (although Jason's is debateable).
* The four characters were picked specifically to torture each other.

This makes me think that all of their deaths were somehow *arranged* by Michael. I guess it's also possible that everything is preordained and that Michael knew about their impending demise, but this seems less likely since their lives were all cut short by freak accidents. Another option is that Jason died first, and this forced Michael to move up his timeline so he could get them all.",TheGoodPlace,1507297031,ghqwertt,9,20,True,,False,True,2017-10-06

Character development between Seasons (Spoilers for S2),"Okay, i loved the pants off the first season of the Good Place. It was clever, the twist caught me off guard, I fell in love with the characters.

Then CLICK, the reset. We get 3 episodes of do-overs. It was quite cleverly done, showing the different perspectives. But something didn't sit right.

At the end of the last season, Eleanor confessed to being attracted to Tahani, if in an offhanded comment and that it'd be explored later. Jason grew a bit as a character, and his relationship with Janet(and her development) was honestly touching. Chidi and Eleanor gaining a degree of mutual affection that felt natural, and they weren't forced into a ship.

But in S2? Both Jason and Tahani have become flanderised, the focus is much more on Chidi and Eleanor who are now pushed into a ship that feels pretty much confirmed by the sex tapes, Janet's been reset again(and ""growing"" through each iteration, but still without her memories that made her ""our"" Janet)... 

I felt like Season 1 was quite clever in how it portrayed Tahani where she started out as a believable but slightly obnoxious person and the seams slowly came undone. But you still sympathised, and you never felt she was a truly bad person, just petty, and it made you question in turn the pettiness of the system that someone like her would be there.

In Season 2 the emphasis seems to be that everyone's just as bad as each other. In some ways, I don't mind this, I'm glad Tahani was knocked off her pedestal as a disingenous privileged rich girl but it also felt like she started to own herself towards the end of Season 1, only for that to be taken away.

I'm feeling really unsure about the show going forwards. I'm exhausted from all the queerbating, especially when it's *outright declared* rather than the teasey stuff like Swan Queen in Once Upon a Time etc., in getting invested in characters only for them to be reset to a point, which in according to interviews has them at about Episode 4 of Season 1. 

I really want the characters to get their memories from the first Cycle, so bad. I thought this was going to happen, but they wanted to focus on the idea that they'd find each other. I'd LOVE if part of the reason for this was that they were somehow all soulmates together(including Janet), and we got a decent Polyamorous relationship on TV for the first time in maybe forever. 

But I'm really worried that we've already lost the development of Season 1 and the characters we fell in love with. The S1 characters, even Jason, just felt so compelling, sympathetic in their own ways. Now they feel like caricatures, and like Michael's pushing everyone out to become the main character.",TheGoodPlace,1507342632,Dollywitch,4,3,True,,False,True,2017-10-06
What do we Absolutely Know to Be True? [Spoilers] S2E3,"I think going forward, we have to disregard almost everything that Michael says. However, according to Janet, she is unable to lie, so everything she says *must* be the truth. I think if we set that as the base assumption, there are things we can learn and know to be real about TGP, TBP and TMP. Such as, 

- There is a real 'Bad Place' separate from where #TeamCockroach is now. It actually has people who are being tortured and they are not enjoying it. 

- Mindy St. Claire and TMP are REAL. And it is a neutral zone between TGP and TBP. 

- TGP also exists, and Mindy St. Claire's house is the point between them.

That's all I can think of right now, but I'm sure I'll add to this list later. Any other things we've gleaned from Janet are welcome in the comments. ",TheGoodPlace,1507344804,Browncoat101,24,17,True,,False,True,2017-10-06

Evading Michael,"So based on what Mindy told us, we know that Eleanor and co. ended up in the Middle Place 15 times, and 15 times with various plans and under various circumstances were either compelled to go back or came back with a plan to outsmart Michael ( and presumably try and save their friends). But doesn't Michael need all four of them to reset the neighborhood and start everything over again when they find out? 

Mindy said that ""It's always at least Eleanor and Janet, usually Chidi's in the mix, sometimes Jason is here. One time Jason and Tahani were here."" I'm making the assumption that this means all four of them have never been at Mindy's at the same time (Chidi and Tahani absent the first time, Chidi absent when Jason and Tahani were both there,etc.). I dont think they'd have any reason to leave if all five of the group are safe at Mindy's. But based on the fact that Michael needs all four of them to make the neighborhood work, couldn't they outsmart him and ensure their memories aren't erased again by just leaving someone at the Medium place? Jason isn't exactly necessary for any plans, so couldn't Eleanor have just left him there when she tried her rescue missions, and then if it failed Michael couldn't reset them until he found Jason,  giving them time to formulate a new plan for everyone to escape back to Mindy's? We don't even know that Michael can go into a different neighborhood, we've never seen him do it, but even if he can he'd have no idea where to start looking unless someone snitched.

"I had a thought (""Team Cockroach"" Spoilers)","I just watched the newest episode, ""Team Cockroach"". In this episode, we see Tahani's cause of death was when she tried to tople over a statue of her sister, but it crushed her. 
Being a fan of *Harry Potter*, I have been trying to figure out since about a week before season two started, (which was about a week after I completed my first watch of season one, thanks to Netflix and a professor at school mentioning the show) which Hogwarts house each of the four humans would be in. Here is what I have so far, so I would appreciate feedback on my thoughts and how close or far off base I am:



* **Eleanor**: I believe that Eleanor would be in Ravenclaw. This is particularly because how how in the 802 attempts Michael has made, Eleanor figured it out in almost all of them, with only two or three we know of where she didn't. One of those would be the reset Michael did on accident. On top of this, the ethics lessons were her idea. Eleanor is also very adept at telling lies and deceiving seeing as she was the top salesperson for her company that sold the drugs that didn't work. She was also never was the ""it"" person to be the designated driver, and it was heavily implied she lied and said another's name when she pulled hers, or maybe she always said a random name, who can say? She also Janet to help her do things. So I could also alternatively see an argument for Slytheirn. 



* **Chidi**: Chidi is a tough one. Since he was ""*literally* a college professor"" (his words) you would think that he too would be a Ravenclaw. However, as in the last episode (at the time of posting) Michael said that in all of those attempts, Chidi never refused to help Eleanor. He is a kind soul, he doesn't want to hurt people, (which, despite this hurting people is exactly what he wound up doing because of his  indecision.) So, I would ultimately say that Chidi would be in Hufflepuff. I would then put Ravenclaw next, since as he was a college professor and writer in life, learning must have been important to him. So I would say he is a Hufflepuff with Ravenclaw tendencies (Personally, I am the flip of this).



* **Tahani**: As we know, while Tahani did good deeds in life, she was doing them for a selfish reason. She was despreate to get out from her sister's shadow. But in doing all of those noble things for the wrong reasons, such as raising £ 5,000,000 for charity and planing on going to help the less fortunate, but it was all to try and outshine Kamela, if only for a brief moment. I fell that Tahani would ultimately be in Slytherin, for her cunning ways, such as that she snuck into the Hall of Fame Induction for her sister, and the fact that she was trying to positively influence her points with a readout stating she was next to last in her neighborhood back in Season One. I am not sure how to offically rule this for her, but I am thinking that she might be a Slytherin with Hufflepuff traits.



* **Jianyu/Jason**: This is the only one that I am not entirely sure about. Jason is an idiot, so he likely wouldn't be in Ravenclaw. He doesn't seem to be all that cunning, (unless he later reveals that he has been playing dumb, which I do not really see coming. Let alone the fact that it would resend my arguments for him to not be in Ravenclaw or Slytherin,) But from there I am stuck.

So, what does everyone think? I'd particularly like to hear from other fans of *Harry Potter*. Do you think I am right on what I have laid out? Do you have any evidence to contradict my claims?

Additionally, I was not initally planing on including Michael or Janet in this. But, if I had to pick I'd say Miachel would be Slytherin with Ravenclaw tendencies and Janet would be hard to place since she is essentially an AI unit. She has infinite knowledge and is able to get just about anything for people. She also has become very human-like with those 802 reboots. I would say that she would like be a Ravenclaw with Hufflepuff tendencies.",TheGoodPlace,1507356766,bowtiesrcool86,5,1,True,,False,True,2017-10-07

Elanor and Tahani are Soulmates.,"After getting generally the full backstory of both Elanor and Tahani I noticed that they are nearlly the same person with two diffrent paths. 

Elanor - Comes from a family who pretty much didn't care 2 shirts about her. This will result in Elanor moving out to live on her own at a young age as she vrutually been rasing herself on her own up to this point anyway. The fact that she is had to do everything on her own and her parents were no help to her is the reason she is so selfish and mean to others around her. Eleanor feels she can't rely on anyone to support her or be there for her for anything as its wired in her brain that in the end she will be dissapointed and can only rely on herself.

Tahani -  Her life seems perfect with a nice house, nice life with everything she could want granted to her no problem. However, Tahani parents care more about the accomplishment of her sister Tahani feels like she isn't apart of the family almost like the unwanted step child. This resentment not having the apprecation of her parents starts to build her jelliousy and hatetread from her sister. In adult her she goes out and does all these big events and charitys not because she cares about anyone she helping , honestly deep down I think living Tanhani could care less about people she finds benith her but she thinks doing all these things will give her attention and a public status that puts her equal or better. Unforcentlly none of this does any good. When Tehani talks with the Interviewer she will get to talk about herself and how great her accomplishment is only find out the woman (or anyone really) cares about her and what she does it's still about her sister. Tahani becomes so overwelmed she stoops as low as to sneak into the party just to cause a secne and ulterimently cause her own death in anger. 

Living Eleanor did not care about anyone but herself but was dying for someone to love and care about her no matter what. Living Tahani would have not cared about people like Eleanor and only acted like this loving supporting person to gain the love and appreciation she felt nobody was giving her.  Tahani did charity acts in order to be liked and noticed meanwhile Eleanor (for a short time) a person who did simlar acts just to feel accepted in The Good Place. 

When the two meet for the first time and through the reboots it's expected the two will hate each other. Elenaor still being selfish and careless of others feelings and Tahani still acting like she is the greatest thing to exisit. Overtime they learn that the people around them love and support them. That neither of them are perfect and both are falwed for the same reason just with altered takes. Chidi help Eleanor see not everyone is like her parents and caring about other people will make them want to care about you. While Jason in a weird way showed Tahani she needs to stop trying to impress people to be cared about just be you and do what you love (what ever she really likes doing). The right people will give you the appreciation and love that you need...if anything love yourself. Jason is a complete idiot who fails at almost everything he does but he makes the best of it and manages to stay postive. The dude got a Jennet to marry him. 

Shortly these two are a perfect balance of the same and different. Each has somthing to offer the other and connect on a emotional and personal level. There was also that one notion when Elenaor said she had feeling for her. ~~If anything they are best friends~~

Was anyone else kind of getting Westworld vibes?(SPOILERS),"Idk if there are any fans of Westworld on HBO, but in the beginning of season 2 and the last episode of season 1, I was getting some serious Westworld vibes. 

For anyone who hasn't seen westworld, (spoiler), it is a futuristic park where artificial intelligence is used as kind of fake cowboys and western people to give people an authentic Wild West experience. Every time they die they get their memories wiped and are reset and do a similar version of their west world setting. As the season goes on, they start to realize they're part of an act, they start to realize that they're getting their memories wiped and they try to figure out how to remember and how to break the loop. 

The scenes In the beginning of the good place where Eleanor opens up her eyes and it's zoomed in on them really reminded me of westworld. Also, the scenes of them o that train are very westworld like.

will we see people from the main four's lives in the afterlife?,"So like. It's been calculated that they've been in the Good Place for at LEAST 200 years, likely 300.

This means that everyone they've ever known in their life is now dead. Everyone Eleanor has wronged, Chidi's best friend, Tahani's parents and sister, and Pillboy.

Do you think we'll see them in some form in the afterlife?

[Spoilers] All 4 are soulmates?,"Yep another soulmates theory.

I was thinking about Tahani being used as one of Eleanor's soulmates in the many different resets. Basically if they can use one of the four - or literally anyone - to be Eleanor's soulmate that kind of renders the concept meaningless. There isn't actually a soulmate for anyone, considering everyone else in town is an ""actor"", and they can use a freaking dog if they want. No matter who Eleanor's soulmate was, she found her way back to Chidi, Jason and Tahani. 

So my thinking is these four are actually all soulmates. Perhaps this is something Michael overlooked, or something he just never considered. But it might solve why so much effort was allowed to be put into this whole experiment for just four people. 

(side note: since ""real Eleanor"" was a demon too, that could mean Michael is just telling the four some random stories about how they died, as real Eleanor was not actually trying to save Eleanor at all, she wasn't even there, obviously. We know they don't seem to recall their own deaths so Michael could literally tell them anything)

So what if the main four somehow all died in a way that connected them and they're actually ""destined"" to always end up together somehow? 

And furthering that, now that Michael is agreeing to join them in ethics, maybe he too will discover he actually needs them or it'll be revealed he was assigned to them for a reason? 

(Also I'm going by the concept of soulmate not being a romantic thing btw, just a general destiny/fate thing)",TheGoodPlace,1507473211,fifthchevron,18,24,True,,False,True,2017-10-08
[Spoilers] On time,"Something that irked me in last episode was how time works. Like Michael knows everything about everything, right? And Janet's database contains every fact in the universe or something.

Yet Michael can't predict the future when Jason asks him if the Jaguars will ever win the Superbowl. So it's not unreasonable to assume they only know facts as they happen on Earth, or at least Earth's realm/universe/whatever. After all, the demons point out a few times how unpredictable humans can be and it's an interest of Michael's (at least when he was acting as a Good Place guy) to learn about human stuff because of unpredictability and what not.

Anyway, the mindfork for me comes to the fact that they've been in a loop for anywhere from 200 to 300 years in all 800ish attempts. And Jason asked him if the Jaguars won the Superbowl *last year*. Like what is ""last year"" at this point? Wouldn't Earth be centuries ahead of them by then? 

But another thing to note is how Michael talks a lot about ""timeline"". So say they died in 2016, maybe every time they get rebooted another timeline adjacent to Earth's 2016 time is created?

But that's still a huge mindfork, as Mindy never gets rebooted and remembers all their previous visits... Someone in another thread suggested that Michael's neighborhood is in some sort of a time bubble, such that they always get rebooted to the same day so that regardless of the attempt number, if they go to Mindy's on day 14 of their attempt, and on day 16 in a different attempt, to Mindy's perspective, they would have popped up 2 days apart and would explain why she's pissed of always seeing them even though it's only like 15 times in 200-300 years and yet she's heard the same stuff enough to quote them verbatim.

But I'm not sure if that makes sense, cause the very first time they saw Mindy it was weeks into attempt #1 so Mindy would have told them ""you guys again?"" or something.

Did I miss any detail that would make sense? Obviously on a more ""this is a show"" level, the Jaguar thing was just a throwaway joke, or might just have been a freebie for Michael to slightly torture Jason, who knows.

[Spoiler]What does janet know?,"I'm sorry if this has already been asked, but I'm curious about Janet's awareness of what's happening. I'd assumed that, since she's a repository of all of the knowledge in the universe, she was aware of the fact that they were in the Bad Place and didn't mention it because she wasn't asked. That would explain why she brought Jason to Eleanor at the end of Attempt #2. I assumed she knew that she kept getting rebooted, that Eleanor and Jason didn't belong, etc.


But at the end of Team Cockroach, she shows that she clearly *doesn't* know everything. She didn't realize she'd been rebooted 802 times, and she seemed to just be figuring out that there were only 4 humans in the neighborhood. Also, in the first (two-part) episode, she seems surprised that Jianyu is actually Jason. Am I off base here? What do you guys think?

[Spoiler] Questions About Team Cockroach,"So the finale to season one blew my mind, I picked that everyone was not meant to be in the good place but didn't realise they were in the bad place. However the idea of a reset bugged me as it sort of takes a step backwards by doing so and the developed characters are now reverted to the more selfish people they were once again. So my question is this. 

Why didn't the gang just ask Michael to give them back the erased memories? 

I figured maybe the reason why Eleanor figured out they were in the bad place every time except for that one instance was because part of her memory somewhere deep inside had inklings of the first timeline. But wait there's more, here's another question. 

Does anyone else think that Michael is in a prison of his own making now and that those in the real bad place do actually know of his multiple failed attempts but erased his memory allowing him to believe they don't know?

"[Spoilers] It increasingly seems like the show's premise only makes sense if the ""Bad Place"" is purgatory, and Michael is trying to *invent* eternal damnation","Assuming Michael is telling the truth, the revelation about being able to travel from the Bad Place to the actual Good Place is what sealed it for me.  Why would it even be possible if it wasn't meant to occur?  Michael goes so far as to state that getting to the Good Place isn't even a real issue, the problem is convincing them to let you stay.  We've also seen evidence that someone's points are still tracked and can change after they go to the Bad Place, which (again, assuming it wasn't trickery) wouldn't make sense if someone was eternally condemned there.  

If being tortured is normally a way for souls to make up for their sins/negative points/etc until they're worthy of the Good Place, then tricking them into torturing each other would ostensibly mean they could never leave. What else (besides sheer eternal boredom) would explain why so many demons are willing to spend decades going along with Michael's convoluted plan, the kind of time/effort/resources devoted to it, and the accolades Michael believes he'll receive?  It would all make sense if the Bad Place is constantly losing souls, and Michael's experiment could potentially lead to a truly grand prize: a way to torture and hold onto people for eternity.  

Many people have pointed out that the fake ""Good Place"" doesn't really seem so bad compared to what other condemned souls are being tortured with, but if Michael's solution exponentially delayed redemption into the Good Place (or prevented it outright), then it would represent a much more significant advancement.  It would also be the kind of twist that seems consistent with the show thus so far.  That all the penis flatteners and butthole spiders are actually ways to *help* people get to the Good Place, and Michael is one of the few demons truly evil and sadistic enough to believe people should suffer forever.

The good place is a project - an attempt to create an oasis of harmony for new arrivals via social engineering, instead of waiting a thousand years for them to catch on.

My theory on Eleanor and Jason,"I just thought of a possible explanation as to how Eleanor and Jason arrived to the Good Place.  Eleanor's name is right, but everything else is wrong, and Jason is completely off.  If one person is there who isn't supposed to than it could be a mistake.  Since there are two I think there is something else up.

In the latest episode Michael revealed that others considered his idea of living with the residents is ridiculous.  Maybe one of these people decided to sabotage Michael's project.  A rival threw in a few bad apples to spoil the whole bunch.  It might have worked.  We shall see next episode.        ",TheGoodPlace,1476422903,CCV21,17,32,True,,False,,2016-10-14
She belongs there (fan theory),"1) If they score all one's good deeds against one's bad deeds, inevitably you're going to get a lot of people who fall on the ""good"" side who barely squeak by. Someone with a score of .000001 would get into The Good Place, just like someone who scored 1 million. Logically. Everyone doesn't have to be super ridiculously good. As long as you don't fall into negatives, you end up in the good place. 

2) We're taking for granted that Eleanor and Jason don't belong there because they kinda seem like bad people. But they both could have barely squeaked by. 

3) The goal of the good place is for everyone there to be happy for eternity. Neither Jason nor Eleanor were happy as the people they were.

4) The neighborhood is perfectly crafted. Not just all the frozen yogurt shops, but each of the people is perfectly selected for the betterment of each other person. 

5) They know how Eleanor died. It wasn't how someone who goes on hunger-strikes and brings aid to Africa died. It seems how she must have actually died. 

--

My theory based on above evidence.

Michael (or God or whoever) intentionally made Eleanor, Jason and potentially others believe they were in the Good Place accidentally so that they would try to better themselves because that self-betterment will inevitably lead to their true happiness.

He didn't have to fudge everything. Perhaps her video memories were visions of what could've been. Her house was an obvious red flag. Michael told Jason he was a monk before he could ruin it for himself and even got his name wrong. (Because Jason is stupid and they had to be even more obvious.)

The people in the neighborhood all work together like interlocking gears.

Chidi loves to teach ethics. 
Eleanor needs to learn to be a better person.

Tahani needs a friendly rival. Competition makes her better.
Eleanor needs someone envy to drive her to better herself.

Eleanor needs Jason to feel like she's not the worst.
Jason needs Eleanor to help him make better choices.

TL/DR: Eleanor belongs there. They made her think she doesn't because becoming a better person is what will make her happy. And it's the role she needs to play to help make others happy in the neighborhood.

Who We Are And Who We Are Not: Practical Ethics And Their Application in The Modern World; A Treatise On...,"**A verbose antidotal informal essay on the area made available to civility in the cultural consciousness.**

Remember when Bernie Sanders was invited to the Vatican to speak on the urgency of injecting morality into the world economy? This is the bottom up application of that from the inside out because it is hard to force someone to be good. This is our responsibility, our part in the revolution, to be masters of ourselves. The meritocracy rewards those who excel in either an area expertise or marketing those skills but does not care how we do that. People are judging how much the ends justify the means from a very bias personal position. This meritocracy does not reward merit, rather it rewards exchanging merit for money. Other areas, including morals, are being neglected for that purpose. Let's pay ethics the attention they are due.  Let's be civil and see how it works out into civics and our civilization.  
~  
It's like how a private school in an area will utilize the best teachers, resources, and some of the brighter kids that would have otherwise been helping the public schools. The rewards for other areas are not as subsidized and they atrophy, operating on a break-fix mentality that tends to hollow us out until we are a house of cards. Family has biological drive going for it and it's hard to beat love as a motivator, art has legacy for ego, but in general society's energy and resources are concentrated into financial merit. That's probably because money is seen as a representation of skill, effort, and time. It's not that we started out taking from other areas, such as personal character, it's that we paid them lip service and then after a while, basically ignored them.  
~  
There is a real decline in religious affiliation, and I think that we as a culture may be inadvertently getting rid of too much along with it such as community and morals. Morals are not an opt in position, they happen if we tend to them or not. We can put effort into them and reap the benefit; We might as well make this bed, because no one else is going to do it and we have to sleep in it.  We, in general, have dismissed a lot of regular time and energy that used to be put into such endeavors with the decline of religion as a cultural institution (sociologically). Too much focus on boundaries can be fixating and there is a lot to be said for tea, a hike, and a good book, but it's not how we used to run things. It's how the culture was balanced. Now there is a loud silence when it comes to talking about fairness and kindness. There is something being lost in transition. I'm not arguing how effective religion was and is at attending to society's morality, nor how ethical individuals are able to do for themselves. But tv, movies, music, and the books studied in school are apparently not up to the challenge of the dog-eat-dog mentality. It is the drive of western cultural ambition that has lead to great leaps and bound for health and science, but we dismiss the downside at our peril.  
~  
Technological advancement is unbelievably powerful in both beneficial and detrimental ways. Fertilizer exploded both food production and, by way of fostering survival, demand. The earth is not 'supposed' to have highways, but few laments the creation of motorized vehicles. The internet is literaturarily awesome, however it shapes us as much as we shape it. The big counter example would be the printing press, codifying our ideas may have accelerated their competition for human thought space, but we have been in conflict with each other way since time immemorial. I hope the internet (and its' cellular capability) to be like the printing press and not the auto. There is a lot of shirts online, but that fertilizer creates the chaos for order to emerge from, an excuse to get out of our cells and come together in interest. Remember all the stuff we had to stop doing because we found out how bad they were for us? How great would it have been to not start doing those things in the first place? I'm saying we stop politely ignoring that there may be a downside before people forget how to be polite, not individuals that already know, but in generations to come.   
~  
The bad doesn't take away from the good nor the good from the bad. There are acceptable ways to act even in the worst human societies, but whether it's chicken or egg, there are beneficial ways of acting that only exist in civil societies. Starting interactions with the intention of goodwill for example creates an environment that fosters our communities.  
~  
Humanity experiences in one second more life then any individual will in their lifetime. That vitality produces a wealth of potential. The problem comes when people start to borrow, sacrifice, and take the energy from developing their character to concentrate on getting ahead individually. We need to take a longer look than our retirements, but more than that we need to take the blinders off and share the experience with others. Why not come in second or forth, or fifty third, with a community around you? Speaking of company, companies sometimes attend to this in a reflection of how much the people that generate their wealth care about it. The Good Place, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are two examples of how our corporate intuitions are trying to help us to eat our vegetables and fill the void. And of course charities are our emergent altruism. Altruism and love are, in fact, self-interested drives. Great ones at that!. They help us improve our environment for the greater good. I can feel the desire in the zeitgeist for the health of our communities. It allows us to pursue endeavors in the environment they provide, including financial merit.  
~  
Human activity scales. We act more maturely but in the same ways when we are five years old that we do in the rest of our lives and we could use options for external correction. Self oversight has been known to be a issue in our intuitions and in some ways we all fight a battle against personal corruption. We also scale in that how we act inwardly is reflected in how we act outwardly (and vice versa) our personal circles, our communities, our nations, and indeed humanity is patterned how the sum of the parts individually act. It appears the mental health of our culture is a bit stigmatized and neglected. I'd be content if morals replaced religion alongside money and politics as something we don't talk about. That way it would at least be in our mindset.  
~  
So in that spirit, what ideas do you have for fostering 'artisanal' (vs corporate) ethics in our communities? Not what morals, but rather how to integrate them into our lives. We are all in this together, and how we treat each other can either make it seem like an ascending elevator or a park. I want the park to be seen as a valid option, so that we can find a balance between the two. It's not us verses each other, it's us verses the problems.

The Good Problem,"Let me start off by saying as the show itself I think its great but when thinking about The Good Place as an actual thing I have a few things that have troubled me from the start. 

1) The Others - from the very start they make it very clear that this place is meant for only the best of the best kinds of people who, to keep things short, for the most part did all they can do bring good to the world. Which is great and all but they refuse to talk about 'the others' the people who never fought world hunger, tried to save a struggling nation, developed some life saving drug or device, the average people who lived decent human lives are simply shafted. From that point alone I knew something can't be right, not everyone can be that perfect and as we saw from Chidi and Tahini not even them were that great as Chidi spent his life working on a book that was supposed to be for the better but In the end not even Michale could figure out what he was talking about. Which comes off to me almost as wasted time as for all we know he could have been thinking complete rubbish and the opposite of what he was going for. Meanwhile Tehani grew up in the shadow of her sister, at least from her  parents. I would think all these great things she's done was simply out of spite a way to prove to her self, her sister, and her parents that she's better and everyone should pay attention to her.  

2) Tehani - Falling off where I left off, it bothers me to have the idea that all she's good for is trying to show that she can be better, richer, nicer, and simpler more popular than everyone else. Even in this ""after life"" she still acts like she's this wonderful, glamorous girl who everyone loves and adores. Volunteering to clean up the neighborhood, going door to door talking to the neighbor's to feel like she ""belongs hers"". Her entire persona just comes off fake. Also why does she still have her English accent? Everyone comes from across the world and they all speak different languages, for example Chidi is supposedly speaking French and we just hear everything through what the other can understand in this case English (American) for Eleanor.  At the party we saw and heard several different people, supposedly all from different countries and we heard them speak fairly with an a American accent all except for Tehani. I thought since its still English she might have gotten a pass but why hasn't anyone else we seen have another?  

3) Soulmates -  How are soulmates calculated and if you died married and get paired with somebody else would that mean that person you could have been married to for say 40 years wasn't your soulmate after all? When I think about this none of the known parings add up.  You have Eleanor and Chidi, one who's a rude, disrespectful, and couldn't care about anyone feelings but her own and the other is a grad who over works himself trying to this perfectly nice and intelligent guy. Then and Tehani and Jianyu (Jason), Tehani grew up with all the big things in life being from a wealthy family and she loves to talk a lot meanwhile her soulmate is presented to be a monk who doesn't say anything (who in actually is a vandalizing wanna be DJ) . The two of them clearly don't belong together, Eleanor and Chidi are are different pages many times and Tehani almost broke by the fact Jianyu not speaking to her ever.  There is still no explanation to what about those who been married for generations. 

Edit : I later thought what if they're meant to be opposite, like this is supposed to be an opposite attraction type deal like Tehani helps Jianyu be more open to the world now that he's not really on it anymore and he helps her stop trying to focus on being so perfect and just relax and enjoy the comfort of your own self minding. While Eleanor helps Chidi stop trying to be Mr . Perfect and right with the world and he helps her to think about others for once becoming a nicer person without needing to change all of who she  since as we can see she's becoming a lot more knowing of the feelings of those around her and not leaving them to dry as she would living but she still hasn't completely changed her way of thinking. However, what debunks this the fact we don't know what the girl Eleanor's is posing as with her memories would be like with Chidi , for all we know they would get along great and Jason is nothing like what  Jianyu so who knows how Tehani could see him. She might think he's some  childish scrum and want nothing to do with him or she may find his way of living refreshing as it's another way to stop being so perfect. 

4)The database -  Janet is said to know just about everything there is to know,  in the pilot Eleanor asks Janet about an ex/guy she knew. Janet then goes over briefly who he was and how he felt about her. Weird thing is if Janet knew that then what happened that in her database if all says she loves clowns and favorite meal is nothing, and has done a bunch of things she never actually did?  

5)Death of age - everyone besides Michael is shown to be relatively young, I know there's different neighborhoods for everyone and this one is somewhat new (how new we I don't know could be many years) but I will assume they will be at least 1 older person 40s at least who can be there as some kind of guidance  and besides for Eleanor we don't really know how these people died. When you consider all these great things they have done seems ironic they'll just suddenly die at young age. 

6)The rest of the land - in one episode Chidi is advised to go explore as Michael tells him there's more out there just beyond where they stand and he wants Chidi to discover it as supposedly they have no idea.  While how cool that will be to venture out and see what else the place offers, shouldn't Michale have some idea of what's else is out there? He says this neighborhood is his first but hasn't he seen others and had a mentor or something teaching him and showing him what's currently out there and of Janet is supposed to know all why doesn't she say anything ? At the very least I'd expect Michale to have already read a book about the place as he's read just about everything else there is . ",TheGoodPlace,1477372787,N3xus11,3,5,True,,False,,2016-10-25
"A possible Theory concerning ""the list""","When Tahani spies on the list behind Michael's back, she discovers that she is second-to-last. We also see that Jianyu is second-from-the-top. 

If you imagine a tournament bracket, they'd be paired up. If you extend this logic, knowing that Eleanor is sixth-from-the-top, it's possible that Chidi is sixth-from-the-bottom. And perhaps the pairs continue on in that way.

So ... we know Eleanor was pretty bad while she was alive, but we absolutely know for certain that Jianyu was worse. I mean, she can at least string rational thoughts together. If the list is really a ranking system, it's possible that it is ranking in order of worst to first. And since Jianyu is in second place, that would mean that whoever is in first place on that list must be an absolute disaster of a (former) human being.

Does anyone have a screenshot of the list? Can we see if Chidi is sixth-from-the-bottom? And who is at the top? 

Anyway, let me know if you all think there may be something to this. And as a side note, I'm so happy I found this subreddit! I absolutely love the show.

EDIT: Never mind to all of this. Someone posted a screenshot of the list in a previous thread and you can clearly see that Chidi is ranked 15th.

Who is Who? [spoilers],"At the end of the last episode it was revealed that there was another Eleanor who was sent to the Bad Place.  It is possible that this is genuine but I noticed something.  

The second Eleanor was only told to reveal herself after the train's departure was interrupted.  That means that the Bad Place group was going to take her back anyway.  

Also you have to keep in mind that people from the Bad Place aren't honest.  It is possible that this second Eleanor is an impostor as well.  A ploy being used by the people from the Bad Place to get what they want.  

If this second Eleanor is false I think the one who may notice is Jianyu/Jason.  He is from a less than reputable background like Eleanor.  Maybe he will recognize a fake because he has dealt with so many before.  Also it would be a nice way for him to have some character growth.  He can choose to remain silent, or he can speak up about the charade.    ",TheGoodPlace,1477630877,CCV21,24,35,True,,False,,2016-10-28

The Bad Place might not be all bad...,"So after watching this episode, seeing Trevor (with Adam Scott gloriously in full-douche mode), I don't think The Bad Place is actually all that bad. I mean, it sounds tacky for sure, but not the hellish two-mouthed bear landscape we think it to be.

I think, given how likely it is Trevor would lie, that he probably has a recording playing on loop of the ""two-mouthed-bear"" screamfest or something to trick The Good Place people into thinking it is really, really, bad. It's probably filled with people like Eleanor, who could be mean and slightly immoral but not downright evil, which is why she's a ""Legend"" there, because she pulled off some awesome shirt (ha).

[Spoiler - Episode 9] My Hypothesis on the coming episodes,"The thing that bothers me the most about this cliffhanger is that they left us with a very, very broad topic to theorize on. There have been many different theories I have seen for the entirety of the show, but after the most recent episode, there is so much opportunity.

However the thing I noticed that seemed to be the most off was...

 * Real Eleanor and Fake Eleanor both died at the near exact same moment, while in the same place, with identical names.

 * It was stated that they have no way to view people's appearances.

 * Jianyu and Jason Mendoza were not at all remotely similar, and it's highly unlikely that even if their deaths intertwined. Even if they did, their names don't share similarities.

 * Originally, I thought it was going to be forgotten about, it's not as important as Eleanor's plot line, but it seems that this IS the most important part.

 * We left on a closing scene where Tahani is waiting for Jason to return to his mancave, her posture is rigid and she has that look [from the Skai Jackson meme.](https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/gotdressed2.png)

My Hypothesis

 * A. Jason Mendoza's real name is Jianyu Li, and he simply went by the name Jason

 *  B. He was, although a rambunctious person and slightly odd person, he may have also legitimately been a good person.

 * C. There is more to it than we know!

The first two are not much more probable, but my last point has me convinced well.

 * Eleanor will be likely sent to the bad place, but then they will find out about Jason and more investigating will be done until they can find out the REAL problem. There is also the possibility that they will intervene at the right time and Eleanor will never be sent to the bad place, but that kind of defeats the purpose of suspense.

Conclusion: No matter how we put it, Jason Mendoza will play a significant role in the later part of the film, but there is too little info to make a sound assumption.

Comment any ideas as to what could come next!

"Question/Hypothesis: Jianyu Li seems a bigger oversight than Eleanor, but may not be in the wrong place","I know I'm not the first to point this out (newly catching up on the show during the hiatus), but it seems from the end of episode 9, while the mixup with the two Eleanors can be explained away that they had the same name, died in the same accident in the same place within milliseconds of each other, and the powers-that-be cannot validate be facial recognition, Jason Mendosa *doesn't* have the same name as his mix-up Jianyu Li and it seems unlikely that he was adopted and is real name happened to be Jianyu Li.

So while I'm not ruling out that Jason/Jianyu Li could have somehow been a similar mix-up (perhaps it'll even be revealed that they died in the same accident in Phoenix as the Eleanors), it seems unlikely and there may well be other factors at work here besides innocent mixups.  Here are my hypotheses:

* Jason Mendosa, while clearly an idiot who made poor life choices, didn't seem like a bad person in the same way as bad Eleanor.  So I'm not convinced that we'll discover Jianyu Li to be in the bad place.
* The Good Place/Bad Place paradigm seems to be somewhat flawed and skewed to a degree of moral elitism.  And Michael seems to be a cog in a much larger, semi-hierarchal system.  So I'm inclined to believe that we'll come to find that someone at another level has been steering these ""mistakes"" in order to buck the status quo, making bad Eleanor (and Jason) guinea pigs in a grander experiment.
* I suspect that there will be other ""misfits"" yet to be revealed within the neighborhood.

I also have some hopes for the direction of the show:

* I hope that despite good Eleanor now being in the Good Place, I liked the inkling of Chidi and Tahani becoming closer.  So while I don't typically ""ship"" these shows, I'm inclined to ship those two.
* I hope that what was started with Chidi working with bad Eleanor and Jason will grow into a new paradigm in this neighborhood and will be embraced by others as a worthy pursuit to reform more souls.

Tahani and The moral system of the afterlife,"So after the season ending twist, I'm left wondering what the real morality system of the afterlife is.

One of the most popular debates in moral philosophy is: do good intentions make you good (Kantian morality), or do good results make you good (consequentialist morality)? This dilemma is personified perfectly with Tahani and Chidi. Chidi has excellent intentions but few good deeds, and Tahani has excellent deeds but poor intentions. We know now that both of them ended up in the bad place. Not only that, but Chidi was actually the closest to making it to the good place, so presumably intentions are more important than results. 

This throws a huge wrench in the point system. The moral system presented in the first episode is heavily skewed toward consequentialism. We see many examples of what gains and loses you points, all based on actions taken, i.e. hug a friend, tell a woman to smile. It doesn't appear to matter why you hugged the friend -- there's an objective point value attached to the action with multipliers applied for how many times you did it. That Tahani could be disqualified just for bad intentions even though she had an incredibly positive effect on the world would suggest that the entire point system we have seen so far is fake. All the times that we saw people's point totals were lies designed to manipulate them, as Michael hinted at when he mentioned letting Tahani see the scoreboard early on. This explains why the system suddenly skewed toward Kantian in What's My Motivation when Eleanor's intentions for doing good suddenly matter: all the better to torture her.

So if the points we've seen are fake, what was the real system used to judge the main four? We know that there is a real good place and bad place since Michael mentioned them in the flashback, and that the real top scorer of the four was Chidi, the best intentioned of them. But we have no idea what the actual rules are, just that they probably aren't as simple as we thought.

[SPOILERS] Fan Theory: Michael's Motives,"The finale flipped the whole show on its head with the realization that they're really in the Bad Place. Michael created the place for these people to torture each other indefinitely. But is he the bad guy?

I believe Michael is still a good guy, ultimately trying to help these poor humans. Here's some thoughts:

1) He stole a Janet from the real Good Place to enhance authenticity. But why do they need to be authentic? Eleanor and friends could be told that anything is ""the Good Place"" and they'd have to accept it. By planting a good Janet, Michael gave the occupants a heavenly tool. She's already proven that she can help them to escape (to some degree).

2) In his flashback, Michael appears much older than his co-workers. Age is meaningless for these demon workers (we can call them demons for now), but I think the fact that he looks so much older than others is that he started this work later. Theory: He was rebellious, questioning why we need to have a Bad Place at all. At some point he realized the best way to fix the system was to join it and quietly make the changes he wanted to see. 

3) Michael is under close surveillance of Shawn and the other board members. Every action needs to be approved, so it all needs to seem like it's hurting the humans. But Michael knows that humans tend to bond in the face of adversity. They work together best when they are humbled. Michael is the hero they need.

There's a lot of possibility here, and I'm so glad Michael Schur is going this direction!

*SPOILERS* Discussion about Tahani and Chidi [Episode 12],"Okay so the giant plot twist obviously, the good place = actually bad place. 

Tahani was sent to the bad place because even though she raised $60 billion for charity she did it to gain the love of her parents and upstage her sister, she did it for personal gain instead of doing it out of the goodness of her heart. So here's my question, if that's true then shouldn't most ""good"" people not get into the REAL good place? Many people don't do good things out of the goodness of their heart but in order to not go to hell a.k.a personal gain. 

Chidi was sent to the bad place, not because he did anything wrong but because he made his friends and family miserable by being so indecisive. But here's my problem, his indecisiveness was something he didn't choose to be , it was an unfortunate trait that he was born with, that he desperately wished to change about himself and they were punishing him for something he can't control. 

These would be my arguments as to why Chidi and Tahani should go to the REAL good place lmao

So What Happens to the Main characters if Michael's plan fails?,"Something I've been thinking about since the finale, now that we know they are indeed in the bad place. Let's say Michael's next shot fails, the characters figure it out, Shawn forces Michael to retire. What happens to the characters? Do they just go to a traditional bad place with fire and brimstone? Because that's what logic would dictate, but it's a really depressing way to end a TV show. Congrats! You fooled the villain! Your prize is eternal damnation! 

Obviously we don't have all of the information yet, as I'm sure (assuming there is Season 2) we'll get more background and probably more characters, but ultimately we now know that these are not Good Place-caliber people. There does not seem to be any precedent or means for a typical happy ending where the characters end up in the Good Place. 

Maybe I'm overthinking it? Maybe a Good Place angel or something randomly ends up in the neighborhood (maybe to get their Janet back?) and takes a liking to the characters (of course, then we'd have to wonder if that was just part of Michael's plan). I'm just sort of thinking that it really feels like this show logically ends with the characters foiling Michael and then being punished for it by going to the usual Bad Place.

Honestly I would imagine that he would have brought it up during his gloating/complaining before the reset.

This was a carefully mapped out plan for the 4 of them to annoy/torture each other for eternity.  Removing half of them would (I would imagine) be catastrophic to that end.

Season 2 Premiere Idea (FINALE SPOILERS INSIDE),"I think most of us assume (and it'll probably turn out to be the case) that the first few episodes of Season 2 will feature the main characters slowly reuniting and having ""deja vu"" until they remember their past. But I've got a different idea that I think would actually be more beneficial to the show.

I hope the premiere deals with the characters repeatedly reuniting and finding out the truth about Michael and them really being in the Bad Place and then having their memories reset over and over again. Essentially, every time they figure out what's truly going on they're immediately sent back to square one (and you could even continue to have Michael be tweaking small things in the background each time they're reset). 

Then at the end of the episode you could finally have Shawn refuse to let Michael continue resetting after his countless failures. Honestly, I have no idea where the show would even go from there (maybe have Michael being punished for his actions by being stuck in the ""Good Place"" and then over the course of the season he'll learn to actually be a better person through the other characters) but it would open up a number of possibilities and keep the show fresh by avoiding multiple episodes of things we've already seen (albeit slightly tweaked).",TheGoodPlace,1484997282,NoChin,8,16,True,,False,,2017-01-21

Theory on Trevor (spoilers),"What if Mindy St. Claire and Trevor are actually from the REAL ""Good Place"" and they're running the reverse of Micheal's plan by pretending to be evil to see if she deserves to move to a better place.

Elenor confesses to being the problem which is the first thing that messed up Michael's plan because it shows that Elenor is growing into a good person. He calls Trevor to come take her because she actually might belong in the good place. 

Now condensing a lot of what happens across episodes 7-9, Trevor shows up saying that Real Elenor is in the Bad Place instead of Fake Elenor and if she doesn't take the spot then he's going to keep this ""Good"" person. If Elenor would have gone right then, my guess is that she would have gotten enough points for non-selfishly taking someone's spot in hell that that train would have taken her to the actual Good Place. It was a test. Trevor even has a line somewhere explaining that Elenor would be much more happy where Trevor is from. When Trevor threatens to call the Judge, he's really saying ""I'm gonna call your boss. Your plan failed, accept it.""

Mindy St. Clair was the second test, Fake Elenor had always been asking for a Medium place and low and behold there is such a place with one person in it. Someone almost exactly like Elenor, who lived a terrible selfish life and riiiight up until the end when she decided to be a good person and got granted clemency for it. 

Elenor could have lived out the rest of eternity getting what she wanted, a Medium Place, but instead she acted unselfishly and took the dive back into what we now know is the Bad Place to save her friends.

Is picking up garbage or pretending to be a monk  *really* as bad as spiders in your mouth and lava monsters?

Did eleanor actually die in the parking lot? What would that mean?,"We saw Chidi's death pretty clearly, and Jason was confirmed dead by the police officer. But we don't actually see the act of Eleanor dying. To take this a step further, in the first episode she doesn't remember dying so she had to have Michael tell her but as we just learned, Michael has the power to erase those memories. Could those memories of her being a good person be real? Could Eleanor have a life altering event that eventually made her in to a good person, and if so is Michael erasing her memories so that he can have more people in the bad place? Remember, during the memories that Michael plays for her, we did see white hands. Sort of also explains why Eleanor actually started becoming good. If she was already on the way to being a good person when the shopping cart hit her, also where her memories cut off, then it's no surprise that she'd still try and be a better person instead of acting like Jason all the time.

It'd be a cool end of series twist to see that Michael went beyond bad and the people from the good place found out. ",TheGoodPlace,1485155568,Hush399,7,11,True,,False,,2017-01-23
[Spoiler] What would you have written...?,"I hope this is formatted correctly as a spoiler! If not, my apologies and stop reading now if you haven't finished the season.

""Eleanor,"" she writes. ""Find Chidi.""

Pretty vague if you ask me, though it serves the story's purpose and sets up action for next season just fine. My question is, what would you have written? You only have a few seconds to write it, so you can't tell yourself the whole story, obviously. But, for the sake of shirts and giggles, let's hear it.

Season 2 overarching plot ideas,"At the end of season 1, Michael's boss gave him the green light to try ""The Good Place"" again, but if it goes sideways, then Michael is through.

I figure a good season 2 plot would be for Eleanor to figure it out again halfway through the season, then Michael realizing his fate would have no choice to bargain with Eleanor.  The tables are turned and Michael is now tortured under this burden. As long as Eleanor and the gang publicly act as though they were greatly annoying each other, then Michael gives them extra perks.   But it becomes a game of chicken, Michael alternating between confessing or shutting up for self preservation.  So sometimes the five of them reluctantly work together as a team, other episodes they want to all kill each other.  

There are still many untouched areas left to explore.  We have no idea what a real bad place looks like, only that the evil designers went out of their way to make neighborhoods for them.  We also have no idea what a real good place looks like either, but it's possible the fake good place was modeled after a real one.  The middle place seems real enough, very likely it gets revisited.  And since Janet learns more each reboot she will likely fall in love again.

And of course Tahani will be all, ""Take your time, we have plenty of it."" (Insert beautiful laugh) Which will make Eleanor even madder. Tahani will still want to throw parties and feel important, again just making Eleanor feel like it's all bullshirt.

Janet's Reboot – A Visual Cue/Clue?,"Sorry, I can't seem to find where/how to specifically format this as spoiler text. So SPOILERS below:


Really minor observation: Has anyone noticed that Janet's hair changes with every reboot? FirstJanet has her hair down in loose waves; after her ""murder,"" SecondJanet — the one who falls in love with Jason — wears her hair in a high ponytail. I watched to see if, after the entire Good Place reset, Janet would just revert to her first incarnation. But she looks like a slightly altered version of SecondJanet, with a slightly less severe updo. It's probably just a visual cue to indicate that it's a different Janet reboot, but I'm wondering if it could possibly indicate that she is closer in temperament and personality to SecondJanet — especially since we've discovered that Janet ""grows"" and ""learns"" with each iteration.

Aside from Eleanor's choice to be good/self-sacrificing, my suspicion is that Michael's theft of a ""Good Janet"" is part of the pivot his failure turns on, and will continue to turn on. Janet is the ONLY neutral source of information in the faux Good Place. She led Eleanor and Jason to Mindy St. Claire, effectively bringing them both beyond Michael's jurisdiction. Whether her ""ride or die"" protocol survived this reboot or not, it seems like we're being visually cued to expect that she won't just be the same Janet we met in episode 1. Her knowledge of love and friendship has grown, and I think that inevitably has to play a role in the 4 torturees finding each other again. Thoughts?

"Some Michael Facts [Surprisingly, Not Spoiler]","So, while Michael Schur have outright said that The Good Place is [not a religious show](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/television/michael-schur-on-the-good-place-ted-danson-and-kantian-ethics.html), one might still wonder whether the inspiration for the name Michael came from religion, his own name [(which would confirm that the title of episode 13 is a meta reference)](/s ""spoilerific sidenote""), both, or neither. Now, I'm not going to post any theory here. Instead I'm going to post some facts (where the selection process is obviously going to be biased (since I'm posting the ones I think are interesting)) about Michael, the religious figure. Then, it will be up to you to decide whether you think any of this might mean something (regarding what has happened or is yet to come), or if I'm just grasping after straws.

&amp;nbsp;

* Michael is the only angel explicitly refered to as an archangel by all Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and their subsets.
* While Michael's specific role/actual identity/feats differ between the religions, all depict him as an **(arch)angel of mercy** and **the one who battles (and defeats) Satan/Lucifer** (the number of times varies however).

&amp;nbsp;

Since the most of the depictions of Michael are within Christianity, the majority of the remaining facts will be the views of its different branches.

* The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy have pretty similar views on Michael. Some of his roles here have been touched upon earlier (a military figure and a leader of the armies of heaven, as well as being the leader of the (arch)angels). The most interesting fact in light of this (so far wonderful) series would however in my view be this quote (copied from Wikipedia):

&gt; *""The second and third roles of Michael in Catholic teachings deal with death. In his second role, Michael is the angel of death, carrying the souls of all the deceased to heaven. In this role Michael descends at the hour of death,* ***and gives each soul the chance to redeem itself before passing; thus consternating the devil and his minions.*** *Catholic prayers often refer to this role of Michael. In his third role, he weighs souls in his perfectly balanced scales. For this reason, Michael is often depicted holding scales.""*

* Islam sort of agrees with this notion, saying that Michael is the one ""responsible for the rewards doled out to good persons in this life"".
* Most remaining branches of Christianity have either suggested/theorized (Protestantism (and its sub-branches)) or explicitly stated (Jehovah's Witnesses/Seventh-day Adventists) that **Michael is the heavenly form of Jesus (i.e. God)** (and that arch angel means the ""head of angels"" rather than head angel).
* The Mormons are the odd ones out here, and say that Michael is Adam.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally (and very unrelated):

* The [Mont-Saint-Michael](http://www.brittanytourism.com/var/crtbre/storage/images/media/images/decouvrir/emblematiques/baie-du-mont-saint-michel/baie-du-mt-st-michel/575658-1-fre-FR/baie-du-mt-st-michel_large_rwd.jpg) in Normandy, France, is almost certainly one of the coolest castles/monasteries in the world (I still hold [Neuschwanstein](http://i.imgur.com/FJnR2oH.jpg) one notch higher however).

&amp;nbsp;

Now if you for some reason have read all this way and have not watched season 1 (which asks the question; why are you even here? (finish the season and come back afterwards)), don't go into the comments. There is an extremely high probability that there will be spoilers.

Jason Mendoza rant [spoilers],"The only thing that I don't like about this show (and I'll die on this forking hill) is that Jason is written terribly. Everything else is great. But a guy that thinks an impressionist painting is art of Frank Caliendo, says pitbull changed the game when asked what music he likes while he's still trying to hide, AND has the wherewithal to keep silent, pretend to be a monk, and slyly get his room set up? No. You can't be nuclear levels of retarded and still have the sense for all those things. This is a person so stupid that he's asking if there's a 7/11 along the train tracks and doesn't understand how to have sex (either she has equipment or she doesn't). There's no way that guy thinks to pretend to be a monk. 


I know what this character is. I know he's *supposed* to be a loveable idiot that you all root for. But Eleanor was a snotty person that bullied people online. He's robbed (or attempted to rob) stores, he's tracked down someone's boat because he was embarrassed and blew it up, he's happy to send someone who really has become a good person to hell if it means that he, someone who doesn't give a shit, gets away with it for free. 


Why would I like this guy? Why would anyone? He's a legitimate criminal. He doesn't have any desire, at all, to improve. 


This is one of the best shows I've seen in ***years***, it's probably my favorite acting from Danson. He made me hate him INSTANTLY in the finale. But I've got such a hangup about Jason and I'm not sure how to let go of it. It's like I have this beautiful, fantastic meal in from of me, and in the center is a small, uncooked beet that's glued to the plate. So I can enjoy the meal, but I have to eat around the beet.

Holy forking shirt I just had an epiphany about Shawn [spoilers],"Given the final episode...he's *not* the boss!! He's the boss of the bad place architects given his position at the meeting. Michael says there that he stole a good place Janet, and if they controlled everything, they wouldn't have to steal. So there's yet another level of shot callers. At least one more. What will they think of Eleanor becoming good after the fact? This is the first time a bad neighborhood was crafted like this so it's probably the first time a human has become good in the afterlife. We know points are real since Michael is working on stuff like that in his flashback, so was Eleanor's point counter sky rocketing a real thing? Did the real powers notice this? Are they questioning it? When will we meet them? 


Michael wants to torture them for one thousand years. Shawn calls six months. ***TIME STILL EXISTS THERE.*** That's huge, because what happens after one thousand years? Is that enough and they go to a medium place, do they go to the good place then? Why put a constraint on it? If time exists, but their state of being is eternal, where will they go after the experiment ends (if it worked this time)? If they DO get to move to a good place afterwards, that means eventually you're released from torture. If eventually you're released from torture, does Eleanor becoming better get her an early release? Does Chidi helping get him one? Tahani? What if the very fact that Eleanor improved tells the real power that they need to re-think the whole thing???!??????????!!!?!??",TheGoodPlace,1485227784,G19Gen3,10,23,True,,False,,2017-01-23

[Spoilers] Thoughts on relationships in season 2?,"    I think that it is going to stay in a kind of Baltar-esque love triangle. Both Tahani and Eleanor have told Chidi that they love him but maybe not in THAT way. Chidi of course hasn't made any decisions on who he loves. I really like Chidi but I can't see him as a serious romantic partner for either Tahani or Elanor. I see him as the one
who ties everyone together.
     Tahani and Eleanor are seriously cute together. It really starts after they bond over watching Tahani's show about unlikely friends and Eleanor giving her hair extensions. Eleanor starts to make comments about how hot Tahani is all the time. And of course Eleanor says she might be legit into the sexy skyscraper. I think it was the second episode when Eleanor was going off about the things she didn’t like about Tahani and ended up getting turned on. And the way they ended the season with Eleanor being into Tahani makes me think that is going to be a part of season two.
     And I really hope Jason and Janet fall in love again! They are so perfect for eachother. They both have a kind of dogged and slightly ignorant way of going about things.

[spoiler] Are the demons also being punished by the bad place?,"Hell is still hell for the devil

Hell is often seen as a place where the devil is the ruler/torturer but at the same time hell is also meant to be the devil's punishment as well.

It get the feeling whatever Michael's ""life"" was before was pretty terrible. Just thousands of years of endless meeting, cubicles, and paper work. Failing to perform would result in ""retirement"" which is being torn apart on the surface of a star. I think Michael honestly enjoyed all the funky human inventions, at least a break from the torture of thousands of years of boring paperwork. 

Perhaps the ""good place"" will turn into his secret way to get out of the bad place as well. Maybe Michael thinks he can use this neighborhood to escape himself. Maybe he simply thinks this closest he can get to the real ""good place"" is a fake one where he needs to occasionally gives Chidi stomachaches so his boss will let him stay. Maybe he thinks he can prove to a higher power that a better use of the bad place is a location to teach people to be better instead of just punishing them for every bad thing they did.",TheGoodPlace,1485304153,Jon-Walker,7,25,True,,False,,2017-01-24

Eleanor and Tahani are very similar.

It wasn't very subtle, because they didn't factor her turning herself in for being a ""mistake"" in the Good Place.

Finale Detail - No spoilers,"I noticed last night while rewatching that in the scene where Michael brought frozen yogurt to Chidi and Tahani, he's dressed like Janet.

[Spoilers] Why should we trust them now,"In the finale they reveal that Eleanor, Chidi, Tahini, and Jason were secretly in the Bad Place the entire time and were never in the Good Place; therefore, showing that Michael has been lying the entire time to them and to the viewers.

But how do we know that he still isn't lying? Why are we to assume that because they discovered that they weren't in the Good Place that he would now be completely honest with them?

If we assume that Michael could still be lying and that the only truth we can state for certain are what occurs in the flashbacks, then the two ideas become possible:

A. Michael, and the show, gave off the impression that people remain in the Bad Place forever when talking to Eleanor, Chidi, Tahini, and/or Jason. But when talking to the other demons, only the first possible 1000 years of torture are mentioned. What if the Bad Place is only temporary and eventually those who reside there are able to redeem themselves and earn a spot within the Good Place?

B. The possibility that Michael is even further lying by agreeing with Eleanor that they are in the Bad Place. They might be somewhere else, but Michael finds it easier/better to just agree to Eleanor that then reveal where they truly might be (possibly some Limbo?). 

To me these explainations would make more sense as to why they picked the four that are chosen to live together. Yes they are designed to be able to torture each other, but the Fake Good Place didn't seem too terrible and all four of them were slowly becoming better people as the season progressed. This explaination would explain that they were chosen to suffer together because everyone's interactions with each other would slowly turn them into better people.",TheGoodPlace,1485367206,johnso6w,12,2,True,,False,,2017-01-25
Changing the System (Fan theory) *Spoilers*,"A few months ago I'd had a theory that Eleanor wasn't sent to the Good Place by mistake, she was sent on purpose to be made a better person (http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGoodPlace/comments/57hggo/she_belongs_there_fan_theory/) It wasn't perfect, obviously, but I was sort of looking in the right direction. There were a few correct elements.

I have a new theory moving forward. 

Michael isn't evil. 

One thing we know almost nothing about right now is the Good Place and the hierarchy of the afterlife. Michael has been an apprentice for who knows how long. When he's finally given a chance to create his own neighborhood he creates The Good Place. Why? As Shawn said ""All this trouble for four people?"" 

It is my theory that Michael is actually from the Good Place or some sort of management tier above either place. He infiltrated the Bad Place because he aims to prove that the current system is unjust. Too many people sentenced to the Bad Place are still worthy of being saved. We all believed it must be the good place because Tahani and Chidi were so certainly good. 

There is a spectrum of people being tortured for eternity and some of them are decent folks.

Meanwhile you have the Good Place. What kind of people are there? In the first episode where Michael is telling Eleanor about all the people in the bad place she realizes that it's unjust for so many of them to be there. If the Good Place is full of people who go on hunger strikes and relief missions to the Sudan, there's no way they would be accepting that someone gets spiders poured in their eyes forever because they stuck gum in public places 226 times. 

Someone would try to change it, and sometimes you have to prove something's worth changing before anyone notices there's a problem.

[SPOILER] A theory about Michael,"What if Michael wasn't the first to think of subtle psychological torture for all eternity?

What if designing the core four's bad place is, in reality, Michael's bad place? He's a career man, being given his opportunity to shine. He has this great idea that he thinks is new, but for all eternity, he can't ever get it quite right. Hence our four, I'd imagine, solving this puzzle every year. They wouldn't do that in his perfect world. Never being able to get this right, no matter how hard you try, would sure as hell feel like torture to me.

Does Janet know? [Spoiler],"Okay, so a lot of the ""clues"" that have been mentioned about the big reveal have revolved around Janet and how she can't lie and says the literal truth all the time -- so, like, her saying it would literally be impossible to visit Jason in the bad place is true because they are already in the bad place, and her mentioning earlier on that she knows ""where it happened"" when talking about the sink hole... these have been pointed out in articles and posts as clues that indicated that it was the bad place all along.

But then last night (yeah... I can't get this show out of my head), I was thinking about it, and remembered the scene where Jason and Janet were talking and Jason says he wants to tell Michael, and Janet says not to, because then Michael would realize that Jason is not Jianu, and would ""send him to the Bad Place""... which would seem to me to indicate that she doesn't realize that they are already _in_ the Bad Place... so

He's actually trying to see if he can rehabilitate souls in the afterlife -- to see if, through suffering, people can become better. In this season, Eleanor really did become a better person -- she started thinking of others, and was willing to send herself to the bad place, in her friends' stead. I think in every reset, they'll make life a bit harder for Eleanor, and she'll rise to the challenge, and get a bit better. I think the last reset will be truly sad/awful, she'll do something heroic, and they'll promote her to the real Good Place.

What was the end game here, just have these 4 be slightly annoyed at a not-so-paradisiacal paradise where things are not quite right? People will adapt eventually, just like that woman did in the medium place.

If a medium place does exist, why not more people there?

[Spoilers] Theory: the middle place,"Eleanor repeatedly feels like she should bein the Middle Place, and asks why there isn't a middle place. I always thought there not being a middle place sounded just... not right.

My theory is (from episode 1 forward, and I feel it still works after the big twist) is that she and the rest of the group actually are in the middle place. A place for people that aren't really bad and aren't really good.

A place for people to prove themselves, and earn their spot in the good place.

In the season finale it's revealed that everybody is supposedly in the bad place, however, that doesn't quite add up to me... let's look at what we know about everyone's lives:

--

Eleanor: kind of a jerk, but not all that bad compared to 'really' bad people, people that lie and murder and cheat - or corporate jerks that get rich off other people's backs. Sure, she was a jerk, but as she mentions once to one of her boyfriends, she just feels there's too much bad stuff in the world - so much that it basically paralyzes and she gives up on trying. It's certainly not good, but not truly bad either. Besides, she was presumably fun and probably gave a lot of people a fun time.

Chidi: he made life hard for the ones he loved. That's pretty much it. I mean, it's a bummer, sure, but it's not like he forced those people to deal with his insecurities. They chose to accept him even with his insecurities. That's not on him, at all. He can't take responsibility for other's choices. Besides that, he spent his life teaching ethics to people, which undoubtedly impacted a lot of lives and must have had a very positive ripple effect. I feel like his goods far outstrip his bads, and him being in the bad place makes no sense.

Tahani: she, like Chidi, was insecure. But come on, raising billions for various charities must have saved and improved hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives. Yes, her motives weren't right, but that's outweighed by her contribution to not just the people in her life, but to people all over the world

Jianyu: I feel like he's closest to actually being in the bad place. He's really kind of a jerk. I think part of it might be that he's actually so dumb he's mentally like a child, and he's not truly bad, in his soul, but he was in the wrong crowd, and they made him bad. Still, he's the most confusing of the group

--

So, I feel like none of them are truly bad, and all of them have potential to be redeemed. I think this is basically what the middle place is: a place for them to improve their flaws and realize their true self, and earn their place in the good place. This middle place may 'loop' as many times as it needs to for the inhabitants to realize their potential.

As far as the soulmates go, I believe they really are. They are actually sort of mirrors of each other and have each others flaws and strenghts.

Eleanor - Chidi: Eleanor has a sense of morality, but doesn't know how to apply it and because of this she just clocks out and ends up a jerk. However, she does know how to just let go and live life. Eleanor needs Chidi to teach her ethics so she realized that it's not useless, and that there is a point to being good. Chidi needs Eleanor to teach him that you can't live only in books and theory, and sometimes you need to say 'fuck it' and live in the moment and live life, for you and for the ones you love.

They're perfectly suited to learn from each other and overcome their flaws.

Tahani - Jianyu: Tahani is super insecure. She constantly feels like she's not good enough. She just wants someone to love her and appreciate her for who she is. She ends up in this endless loop of trying to please people who cannot be pleased and ends up doing a lot of good for the world, but she's unhappy herself. Jianyu doesn't think of anybody BUT himself. He just does what he wants, when he wants. And actually, he's fine with that, he doesn't feel guilty about that, and doesn't care about pleasing anyone.

Jianyu is the perfect person to teach Tahani how to just do her, and be proud of who she is without needing outside approval. Tahani in turn can teach Jianyu the value of doing good for others.

--

So to sum it up, my theory is that the four of them are in the Middle Place, 'stuck' in a loop to earn their place in the Good Place by personal growth.

Similarities To The Sims? Intentional or am I reading into it?,"Every time I watch The Good Place I get the strongest urge to play The Sims 4 (a game I binge on for hours a few times a year.)

The music is extremely similar, as is the colour palette. But most importantly so is the concept - the designer creates a ""Neighbourhood"" stocks it full of NPCs, and but only watches a particular family. Plus it's always a better game when you put your family through as much drama as possible, and of course it's well known that it's fun to torture or kill your Sims in creative ways.

Eleanor and Tahani's Friendship,"I liked the dynamic of Eleanor and Tahani's friendship in the show.  Both characters serve as a foil for the other.  At first, Eleanor was feigning politeness to Tahani.  Then it became genuine when Eleanor comforted a crying Tahani.  

Their friendship hit a bump in the road when Eleanor revealed herself.  Tahani was at first shocked and felt betrayed.  But she did make an effort to stick up for Eleanor.  

Then Tahani found out Jason's secret, and both ended up confessing feelings to Chidi at the same time.  Tahani was justifiably upset at Eleanor because she knew Jason had been deceiving her, and felt threatened a love rival.  Eleanor deescalated the situation.  Rather than making each other feel horrible, Eleanor decided to make each other feel better.  Saying ""We have a weird, forked up friendship, but it's ours and I care about it"".  (paraphrased)  Tahani was able to get her senses back together and thanked Eleanor for [being such a good friend](https://i.redd.it/n4wwkh0z85cy.jpg).

As we saw in flashbacks in Tahani's life she may have lead a glamorous lifestyle, but it was lonely.  This is probably the first time in her existence that someone acted like a true friend to her.  Every other friendship or relationship Tahani claimed to have was most likely very shallow.  

As I saw their friendship grow something else came to mind.  Eleanor and Tahani aren't that different.  While the circumstances weren't the same, both had neglectful parents.  This influenced them and set them on a course they followed until they died.  One difference is that Eleanor separated herself from her parents while Tahani tried to earn her parents approval.  

Even though it wasn't intended they became friends.  ",TheGoodPlace,1487055363,CCV21,7,40,True,,False,,2017-02-14

I can admit when I'm wrong...,"I caught the first few episodes of this show because of Michael Schur and the concept sounded unique. I walked away three episodes in, deeply disappointed. My first episode prediction was spot on and I just assumed that the season would deal with revealing that to us, which I thought could be great if handled well. But then as the episodes kept rolling I found the humor so safe and broad that I literally forgot my own prediction. I just figured this would be one of those shows in which every episode follows a redemption arc so that every episode is about Eleanors wacky friends helping her become a better person to forestall the end of their universe. Hardly groundbreaking and my time is too finite to sit through formulaic sitcoms, so I left. 

I came back to the show when I saw a reasonably smart friend tweet about the finale and I have to say, that episode completely redeems the show for me. Looking forward to season 2.

Don't think Eleanor [spoilers],"So here's my theory: I don't think Eleanor is dead at all. I think she's dreaming or in a coma.

First, there is no reason to assume she is dead because the only person who ever said it was Michael and he is now proven to be a faulty narrator. Eleanor had conveniently forgotten how she died. (Michael claimed her memory was erased.) And even when we see the shopping cart scene, we don't see her die. Besides, unreliable narrator Michael said ""real"" Eleanor (Vicki) tried to save her. We KNOW that is a lie now.

So if Eleanor is not dead, what's up? Hard to say given that we don't know everything, but maybe Schur's end game could be something like:
1) Chidi is a professor in a Learning Annex kind of place and she took his course and has fallen asleep.

2) She was reading No Exit and fell asleep.

3) She was reading What We Owe to Each Other (a book Chidi taught from AND the book from where Eleanor ripped paper to write the note to herself) and fell asleep.

4) She actually was hit by the shopping carts and is in a coma. Lots of showrunners using coma fantasies these days (The British Life on Mars, upcoming season of Archer).

Finally, an observation. The only death was HAVE seen is Chidi's (hit by a/c). We HEARD about Jason's death, but didn't see it. Tahani we know nothing about. And Eleanor, as I've said, I don't believe is dead.",TheGoodPlace,1487998510,angeloanthony,11,16,True,,False,,2017-02-24

What was micheal's plan? [Spoilers],"So the end of the season was building up to the moral choice that they would have to choose who was going to the bad place, but then Eleanor figured it out.

The group would be separated so there isn't the torturing of each other as Micheal wants. Plus two of them would just be suffering in fire and brimstone.

[spoilers] Ethical implications of the finale,"So I'm taking Ethics right now, and the Good Place has always been a good conversation starter considering how much it references ethics (and considering how Chidi is pretty much the opposite of my professor). After watching the finale, it brings up a lot of questions because of the reasons given for Chidi and Tahani being sent to the bad good place. Tahani is a bad person who does good things, while Chidi is a good person who does bad things, yet both are labeled as bad. Considering the point system given by the angels, it is likely that this universe accepts some form of ethical altruism. However, why is it that in one case the intention is the decider of a good person, where in the other, intention is completely disregarded in favor if the end result. Could there be an ethical system in which intentions and results are both taken into account? If so, how is one weighed against the other?

Chidi is a terrible philosopher? (spoilers),"Spoilers!

I only have an undergraduate degree in philosophy, so obviously I'm not an expert. But I do know a thing or two about how moral philosophy is supposed to run, and Chidi blatantly does a terrible job, both as a teacher and as an academic.

* The first book Eleanor reads for his class is *On the Way to Language* by Heidegger.  Heidegger is a notoriously horrendous author to read, especially for beginners, and this book is only tangentially related to practical ethics.  Right off the bat, not a good look for him.

* Then, Chidi just accepts at face value that Michael's bosses have figured out ethics.  He doesn't ask for any sort of rational justification, which is supposed to be the bedrock of philosophy.

* Even after he accepted that The Good Place has it all figured out, for some reason Chidi also teaches Utilitarianism as a valid theory.  In the very first episode you find that you get points for things like ""being a lifelong fan of the Cleveland Browns"".  Given that, and the fact that if Utilitarianism is true then only total happiness matters, then Chidi should have immediately concluded that Utilitarianism is false.  That's basic logic.

While watching the series, I sort of just played this off as the writers having never taken anything other than Intro to Phil, but then the ending happened and I had to think again.  Was this supposed to be a clue for people who knew a bit about the subject?  Chidi was supposedly in ""The Good Place"" because he devoted his entire life to the study of ethics.  But his actions in the show lead us to believe that he was really really bad at it.
