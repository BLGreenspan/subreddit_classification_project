Opinions on April?,"I'll preface this by clarifying that as of right now, I've yet to finish the show (on Season 5)-- however, I do know most major spoilers, so don't be afraid to reference other stuff below.

&amp;#x200B;

So, unpopular opinion I believe ahead: *I don't like April.*

Obviously everyone has their views on different characters, and given that I'm making this post, I want to hear from the greater P&amp;R community. But I don't really see the appeal of April Ludgate.

Yes, she has her moments. But even Mark had his moments, and he's (not a *bad character*) a dry character; one who clearly held no purpose and they removed him rightfully.

I've seen threads on this topic where people discuss how she's matured, yet in every major instance of her character, she's just unpleasant. She's lazy, unmotivated, condesending, and downright rude in most instances. I think the best example of this is when Ben goes to Washington to work on the campaign, and she's just a total jerk for the entire episode. She leads Ben to believe that there's a deep divide between himself and the interns (which there is, granted), but in the end it was her making the caricatures. She even tries to fight him when he defeatedly asks for ""15%"", not taking him seriously. Also with Ben, her and Andy in like Season 3 are completely unmanageable. Yes, someone like Andy-- funny and sweet but a literal mandchild-- is understandable to be disorganized and socially inept (even given his age), but April almost pressures him into wasting his money on crap they don't need nor can afford.

April feels like someone who has gotten too cozy and engrained in her surroundings and is entitled to do or say whatever the hell she wants. I hate people like that.

The thing is, a character doing stupid or annoying things or even saying something stupid isn't necessarily bad for the audience. Andy's entire character is based on radical impulse and him saying whatever drags his attention away first. Tom is annoying, but well meaning especially in the later part of the show. With April, she's never truly redeemed. Even during the dog park fiasco with Leslie where they eventually ""make up"", Leslie's reaction wasn't ideal, but this *was* April's fault. She struggled to reconsile even though she knew Ann was right about her behavior, and was tacked onto the park's organization team because of a side project.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you might argue that it's her character or even that it's the actor. This isn't meant to offend Aubrey Plaza; I'm sure she's a kind person in real life. But the writing for April just irritates me to the core.  I can't enjoy her.

I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE JUST UPLOAD THE EXTENDED VERSIONS

OF CHAPTERS 5 AND 13 OF THE FIFTH SEASON.



AND SINCE I CREATED THIS TXT, I WANT TO SHARE SOME THINGS WITH

THE FANATICS OF PARKS AND REC.

I AM A FAITHFUL FOLLOWER OF THE SERIES SINCE THE FIRST CHAPTER. AND TO BE HONEST,

THE FIRST SEASON I WAS NOT CONVINCED AND THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CANCEL IT IN ANY MOMENT. THOSE WHO SAW IT FROM THE BEGINNING MAY ALREADY UNDERSTAND IT,

BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER IT, IT SEEMED THAT THE SERIES DID NOT FIND HIS TONE.

FOR LUCK FOLLOWS AND WAS IMPROVING A LOT WITH TIME, AND CHARACTERS THEY WERE FINDING THEIR RHYTHM AND TODAY ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL. IN REALITY I STARTED TO TRANSLATE IT BECAUSE IN THEN NOBODY  DID IT

(ARGENTEAM BEGAN IT, BUT HOW IT HAPPENS WITH MANY SERIES, THEY LEFT IT),

AND I WAS LIKE A SHAME THAT BY THE LANGUAGE MANY THEY LOSE THIS GREAT SERIES.

(EVEN THE SONY CHANNEL LEFT IT).

AND THEN I TAKEN IT AS A RESPONSIBILITY, SO THAT EVERYONE COULD ENJOY IT, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO SAY ""THEY WAIT FOR MY SUBTITLES TO SEE IT, IS THE BEST COMPLIMENT I COULD EVER RECEIVE AND THERE ARE SO MANY MESSAGES
SO CUTE THAT MAKE ME WANT TO FOLLOW WITH THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE ARE FEW THE FOLLOWERS, WE ARE SUPER FAITHFUL.

THERE ARE THE MOMENTS AS THE ONE THAT COMPRATES APRIL AND ANN IN THE LOT, TOM AND ANN AT THE PARTY,

AND LESLIE AND ANN AT THE END (IN THIS PART I WAS AS ANN WHEN RON SPEAKS)
THOSE WHO DO THIS INCREDIBLE SERIES. AND OF COURSE I DO NOT FORGET ABOUT ANDY, RON
AND DONNA. I LOVE!
IN REALITY MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANTED TO WRITE THIS TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO I WRITE THOSE THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND TO SAY THEM THAT EVEN SOMETIMES I LATE AFTER
A LITTLE BIT, MY INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE MAKING THESE SUBTITLES, BECAUSE IT IS ALSO SOMETHING I ENJOY A LOT.

AND GOOD, I LEAVE THEM BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO TO DISPOSE OF ANN, AND AFTER I SEE THEM

AT JJ'S CAFETERIA TO EAT SOME WAFFLES WITH A LOT OF CREAM.

What's your favorite episode?,"I've gone through Parks and Rec three times now, well I'm on season six but close enough to the end, and I think I've done enough research to finally say what my favorite episode is.

Well, in this case it is episodes. London Parts 1 and 2. Watching it right now I've realized that every single time I watch this on Netflix I laugh harder than I have at any other episode. So many fantastic moments.

April looks dang good.

It also drives the plot in a big way. Chris and Anne announce their pregnancy, Andy goes off to film Guardians of the Galaxy, Ben gets a large amount of corgis, Tom gets an arch nemesis, Jean-Ralphio and Mona Lisa are used to their potential.

There is no better episode than London.

I finally understand Tom and Jerry,"Like the famous cat and mouse duo, they're workplace opposites. Maybe you've worked with some Tom and Jerrys.

Tom is the entrepreneur. He's swagged out in expensive suits, constantly trying to network, and looking to build an empire.

Jerry is the everyman. He does a decent job, is nice to everyone \(despite being the butt of their jokes\), and is riding it out until retirement.

I've always been a bit of a Tom. I've spent the past 5 years living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York starting ventures and side\-projects the whole time. I've been dead broke and I've been 🎶 FLUUUSHHH WITH CAAAAASSHHH 🎶 

Recently, my partners and I dissolved an investment fund we started so I totally empathize with the Entertainment 720 fiasco. I've returned to my hometown, a pleasant little suburb in nowhere\-USA, to spend time with my parents. 

I don't know what I'll do next but working in a cubicle for the rest of my life terrifies me. Nothing sums up the feeling better than this:

&gt;*I guess I’m Jerry now. After work I’ll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a home\-cooked meal with my three beautiful daughters. What a miserable life.*",PandR,1525405215,FailFastandDieYoung,3,9,True,False,False,True,2018-05-03

Being a PnR household, my hubby suggested we make up personas and go all dressed up. We talk in gifs constantly, and I want one to refer to our new adventure. Sure I could use Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole, but that's so used. Has anyone seen a gif around of this scene?

I can't help it but i just hate donna,"I am doing my first rewatch of Parks and Rec. One of my all-time favorite shows. It got me through tough times at the hospital about 2 years ago. But I can't help to just hate Donna.

I thought it was just the first and second season that made her seem so awful, but I am nearing the end of season 4 and I just hate her. I hated her during my first time watching and I just hate her again. 

She is obsessed with her Mercedes for no reason. When Ron got shot by Tom she goes all beserk, not because her boss was shot, but because her car window was smashes. When Tom needs help moving she allows one tiny box into her beloved car. She is just mean to most people. When Ann asks her help during the dating session she tells her to fuck off and only helps her later on. She is beyond self-centered and not even getting everyone to call Jerry Garry can save her. When Tom wants her to buy into Snakehole with him she listens and then just buys her own shares. And then Tom has to sell his share, but she gets to keep it. She doesn't stick by him, help him or anything like that. She pretty much threatens him not be a snitch. She has a cabin and refuses to tell people about it, because 'Meagles are not welcoming people' or whatever. Then she has tons of bs rules. 'You do not have access to the hot tub' or 'upstairs is Meagle only space'. Nice behavior towards your friends. 

I know the writers didn't do much with her, but that's not an excuse. Out of all the 'good guy' main cast, I absolutely despise Donna. ",PandR,1525716606,michaeltakai,6,0,True,False,False,True,2018-05-07

Why Parks and Rec is special: its message of hope in the face of adversity,"Watching an average of 2 episodes a day over the last two months I finally finished the series last night. I wanted to talk about and share why I think Parks and Rec is so special.

There’s a lot of good shows on television right now. But a lot of it is also grimdark. Game of Thrones showcases the brutality of war, incredible violence, and decent people living in an indecent world. Black Mirror and Westworld are both high quality cinematic and narrative experiences, but they are also a commentary on the dangers of technology, the baser instincts of humanity, and full of just good old\-fashioned [nightmare fuel](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel) \(TV TROPES WARNING!\)

Parks and Rec isn’t that. It’s the complete opposite. I think the message of the show, if there is even such a thing, is one of hope. Leslie Knope is a life preserver at a time when you turn on the news, or go on the front page of Reddit, and see corruption, greed, and callousness in our politics and way we treat each other. On Parks and Rec, the characters treat each other with respect \(sorry Larry\-\-oh\-\-I mean Garry\) and at the end of the day put aside their personal and political differences to accomplish things that benefit their community, themselves, and their friends. Much like The West Wing, the show has that same hopeful optimism that good government can and should exist. 

On the show Knope is forced to deal with ignorant citizens, corrupt and sleezy politicians, and callous and greedy companies, but she always emerges from these encounters with a sense of renewed optimism \(with a little help from Anne after she loses the recall election\). She's still that same optimistic, headstrong person from when the show started. It speaks to resilience in the face of overwhelming adversity. 

The growth of the characters over the last two seasons makes me reflect upon my own accomplishments. I’m at a stage in my life where I want to move on to bigger and better things, and I hope I can take away that same hopeful optimism for the future that was captured by the series finale.

Or just take Chris Traeger’s words as motivation: “There is *literally* nothing in this world that you can’t do.”",PandR,1525796753,jbmoskow,1,26,True,False,False,True,2018-05-08

&gt;Women. Aren’t we all women if you really think about it? Maybe. But, what about men you ask? Can a man be a woman? And, if not, what can a man truly know about a woman? The greatest woman I know, told me to always ask questions (note from Leslie: that was me!). So, I ask you, now: what is a woman? Wrong. What isn’t a woman? Guess again. Abigail Adams was married to John Adams, and was the mother of John Quincy Adams. She was a woman. Or was she? I was assigned to write about her. Was I? I don’t know. Think about it for once. Thank you. Has this been 1,000 words? I sure hope so. The assignment was to write 1000 words. One thousand! Words! So many words. So many women, so few who were married to John Quincy Adams. Makes you think. From, Andy.

- Chris details one of his visits with Dr. Richard Nygard. 
&gt; I am extremely depressed. I looked at my calendar today and realized that my favorite Sierra figs are going out of season. It was crushing. They are a digestive system’s best friend, and delicious to boot. I cannot stress enough how predictable my bowel movements are with one fig in the morning. But, as I explained this to Dr. Nygard he directed me to think of the new season. The second he said that, I screamed, “Beets!” Just remember: every end of one season is the beginning of another. In this case: figs and beets! And then Dr. Nygard made me realize this doesn’t just apply to fruits, it can apply to anything in life. But, also, beets are coming!

- Ron does not like the games ""Jenga"" and ""Sorry!"".

Just rewatched the series for the nth time. here are some of my thoughts.,"This show is incredible, but you all know that. Rewatching this as I'm trying to graduate college and pick a path in life, I really related to Tom and April. Tom was swinging and missing at everything, April couldn't decide on what to do so she stayed put. I feel like these two characters are kind of the two opposite ends of the pool. On one end (Tom), you wanna just dive in to see how the water feels. You might hit your head and drown, but at least you feel the water. On the other end (April), you're unsure if the waters cold so you never even dip your toe in. So, I'm trying to find that spot where I feel comfortable. 


The ending brought me to tears... again. I'm a sucker for the way they went into each character's future. Laughed so hard when Craig said he regretted the trout. And the very end with the photograph, the camera zooms into Leslie as she says 'I'm ready', and the Traveling Wilburys start to play. Beautiful. I'm crying again.


I'll leave on a good note. This is one of my favorite quotes from the series: 


Ron: Anne was getting a little chummy. When people get a little too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them.


April: That's a really nice move.


Ron: Thank you.


April: You're welcome, Lester.",PandR,1526031109,alecjperkins213,1,16,True,False,False,True,2018-05-11

Its warmth and light-hearted nature was just so unique and the development of all the characters was so fun to watch (I was particularly amazed at how well Rob Lowe and Adam Scott's characters joined in and really brought the show to a whole new level in season 3).

So now I'm wondering, if there's any suggestions for any shows similar to Parks and Rec (not including The Office UK/US), particularly any that share the warmth that this show has?

Office fans get easily offended when you say Parks and Rec is better,"I personally think both shows are great in their own ways. The office has its moments and Parks and Rec always makes me laugh. 

But there’s a guy I know who literally worships the office and I decided to mess with him. I told him Parks and Rec is funnier, and he literally had a meltdown. It was actually scary how offended he got when I told I liked PandR better. So then he pulled the ole’ Parks and Rec copied the office excuse. 

I don’t believe PandR copied the Office, but there definitely was some inspiration from the office. 

So then he continues to this day to argue with me, when secretly it was a joke. He won’t let it go. 

I definitely feel like the whole office fan group has this stigma that their show can only be the best which is pretty narcissistic and ignorant. And because their show is so perfect, they feel they can rub it in everybody’s face. 

I like both shows, but happen to enjoy Parks and rec more, because it revolves around a lot of characters rather than an office feeding off of Micheal. 

I still think the office is funny, but these circle-jerking office fans kind of ruin it.

Leslie, Ron, April and Andy host a rally to keep JJ's open. When that fails, the group finds a way to relocate JJ's, while convincing Gryzzl to restore a rundown area of Pawnee for its new headquarters and gain some badly needed publicity points by donating the Newport land for a national park.

### Series Finale ""One Last Ride""

|:--  |:-- |
|**Synopsis**|In the last day in Pawnee, Leslie rallies the entire team for one last Parks Project: fixing a swing in a park. A series of flash-forwards show bits of what will happen to the characters over the next years and decades. Typhoon and Craig get married, Andy and April become parents, Donna sets up a non-profit with her husband, Tom becomes a best-selling author, Garry serves as Mayor until his death at age 100, and Ron finds happiness in a job as a park superintendent for the National Park Service. Ben is elected to Congress, and he and Leslie are separately courted to run for governor of Indiana. After considering who should run, Ben decides that Leslie would be a better candidate. The two then visit the Parks department and see all of their friends once more. Ann and Chris reappear and decide to move back to Pawnee. In the future Leslie serves two terms as governor, and hints at a ""new, unknown challenge"" in a speech; at Garry's funeral (depicted earlier in the episode, but occurring further in the future), she and Ben are accompanied by what appears to be a Secret Service detail, in a scene left intentionally ambiguous.|

"I am sorry, but, ann kinda bothers me So far(Just started season 3)","Sorry about the title, I don't know why it formatted strangely.  I guess this has spoilers if you have not watched as far as the beginning of Season 3.

Also, please no spoilers for me, friends.

Hi everyone.  I want to like Ann and I do like her when she is being Leslie's friend.  That is when she is at her best, so far.  But I have a pet peeve about people who act really nice and caring to everyone, but then are actually selfish and no one notices it.  For example, she looked down on Andy the whole time (which I get, I mean he was childish and a slob and all that) but did not appreciate his good traits.  And when he tries to win her back, she gets all condescending and acts like he is subhuman.  Andy is a mess, but an adorable mess who has an amazing heart.

I think as a caretaker personality, Ann does get something out of sort of feeling better than people who are sick and stuff.  That sounds terrible.  It may just be because I know caretaker type people like that IRL who are only able to be a good friend to you when you are not well or your life is a mess.  But, when you are better, they can't stand to be around you, and sort of want you to stay a mess forever so they can be the sane and functional hero, saving their train wreck mess of a friend. It can hurt.  

Anyway, that isn't the main point, but what really grinds my gears is how as soon as she sees that April and ~~Chris~~ Andy might actually be happy together, even though she actually has a man herself and has options, she can't stand that.  She can't just let the two of them be happy, she feels completely entitled to mess that up because her ego can't stand that she lost a guy and that gasp, another woman, might get him.  

It just strikes me as incredibly ruthless and selfish, and nobody is going to call her out on it because she comes off as a caretaker.  But she uses the caretaking to make herself look good and always has this kind of ""I am so patient and saintly"" attitude.

Regarding her character.  Basically, her actual character I cannot define.  I know her roles--nurse, Leslie's friend, and the Straight Man.  Otherwise in terms of her actual personality coming out, the main thing I can think of is that incident above, of selfishness.

I don't think she is the best straight man.  April and Ben are both good...April is completely a unique character of her own, with her quirks, but she also has that teenage ""I can't believe this BS"" attitude without being a total jerk, because you can tell that she is soft at heart and really cares, but just doesn't like to show it.  Ann is the opposite, she comes off as the most caring giving person, but when it comes down to it, she gets angry that another woman might make her ex happy.

Ben is great so far of the little I have seen, because he is the total serious guy but he does not have to break character to be the straight man.  Ann basically to me is just Jim &amp; Pam from the Office mixed together.  They think they are better than everyone because they are ""normal"" and not ""weird"" like everyone else, which is a really high school attitude.  Having the straight character is completely possible without them being condescending and superior to everyone.

Anyway, I am not saying the show shouldn't have had her, or anything, necessarily, but I just feel like she breaks the flow.  And, I feel that I was expected to really like her, and that bothers me, because I don't actually think she is likable.  I just know a lot of real people who like to act really caring, and can be giving, but when it comes down to it they like to feel superior, and are kind of out for themselves.  Why didn't she look in the mirror and realize that trying to ruin things between Andy and April is a jerk move?  Just because she thinks she ""created"" Andy by taking care of him, somehow.  In fact, she kept him dependent, and only when he hit rock bottom did he turn his life around.

Even her and Leslie, she is a true friend to her, but she likes to get that attitude about her too.  ""Wow, look how messy my crazy friend's apartment is,"" and all that.  

I feel a lot of people love her so I am not sure how anyone will react her, but I just want to say this.   Thank you.

Edit: I will say that if I see her character develop later, and I see people call her out on her flaws, and I see her realize her imperfections, I will be much more satisfied with her presence.   I do fear however, that this may not happen.   

I actually find it very unnatural that nobody ever clashes with her in the show so far.  Andy and Mark only clash in the sense of wanting her back.  It's not any kind of fight or argument  per se.  Now, you can definitely argue that her attractiveness explains why they act that way.  Still, most of the characters are involved enough that occasional personality clashes happen.  Even Trish and that attractive journalist lady get in disagreements with people. 

Since Ann isn't a Parks employee, she is very separate.  Never actually down to earth and real enough to have a personality conflict.  It's jarring to me.  ",PandR,1495150047,Rivkariver,23,8,True,,False,,2017-05-18

Ann replies by saying that it's not good that they never fight, that couples are supposed to fight. 

Alright, so basically, I've been dating this girl for almost four months now, it's my first ""real"" relationship, I guess you could say, and we were watching Parks together when this episode came on, and I just felt kinda awkward about it.

This is the only other plot device from a comedy that I actually think rivals HIMYM's main plot device. 

When Anne and Chris left, I was bummed out because I loved both of the characters. I immediately google why they left, and the interview I was looking at seemed to make a hell of a lot of sense from a producer's aspect. They were moving onto one of their final chapters in life, starting a family. Pawnee was the place that they met, and that would always be magical to them, but it wasn't the place they needed to be in to settle down.

Leslie and Ben having kids is where I was thinking about the show is ending just as everyone is really starting to have their lives to come together - so I really did not want to see the show ending as the lives are forming. This is why I feel I maybe biased, but aren't we all? 

Skipping forward in time allowed for many different things to take place; Ron and Leslie's beef was just hilarious to say the least, ending with the hysterical can episode where they don't leave the office...I really wanted Leslie to try and break the glass just for Ron to say he had unbreakable glass installed, but that's off-topic...the predictions is definitely one of the best things about season 7!

Just like how Back to the Future had us for years and years saying ""I wonder if that will actually come to light."" PandR had us doing the same, and we were all doing it this year. We just had to contrast the show from reality, to show how far off (or better yet, close to) the 'predictions' were. I know they weren't really predictions, but still!

Then we got that kick-ass finale that imo is actually the best thing about comedies ending...they always have amazing finales! Don't bring up HIMYM's to me, because I'm actually an advocate for believing the finale was amazing, so there's potential to feelings being hurt on both sides. If you want to discuss that at all, feel free to PM me because I always love discussing TV --shit, I really did go off-topic there, sorry-- we got it with HIMYM, Community, Psych...we got those wholesome episodes at the end where even though it was ending, we cried happy tears for our characters. 

It's very hard to use flashbacks, or flashforwards as a main plot device. The only time I can recall a show using flashbacks as a main plot device, and doing it well, is Person of Interest. It used drips and drabs as a mystery invoker and to increase hype surrounding certain characters like Grace and Harold. You could've just had an episode with Reese and Finch thinking they're about to die in this room, and have them spill the beans about their pasts. 

The fact that PoI is one of the only rivals to the level of flashbacks on PandR, in relation to PoI being one of the better dramas in the past decade, and PandR being known for its satire and goofy comedy speaks volumes. When it's revealed that Ron was stood up by Leslie, I think most of us wanted to give Ron a hug more than laugh at him.

Parks and Rec UK boxset.,"It's $30 on US Amazon but 65 quid over here, that's just not how exchange rates work. I want to support the show and have it permanently, but DVD is a dying medium and that's a big montary commitment.

Is there any chance of it being added to UK Netflix?
Or, is there another alternative to get it cheaper? (Second had is more than okay)

The characters' votes in the 2016 Presidential Primary - and why,"Just randomly thought about this: who each P&amp;R character would vote for.

*Leslie - Hillary - She's sympathetic to what Bernie says and wants, but there is absolutely nothing coming between her and voting for the first female president.

*Ben - Hillary - Wavers a lot between Hillary and Bernie, but ultimately decides Hillary after months of analysis with a nervous breakdown or two thrown in.

*Tom - Feelin the Bern, baby!

*Ron - No matter who you vote for, they're just going to take advantage of hardworking taxpayers for useless spending.  Doesn't vote.

*April - Doesn't vote in either the Democratic or Republican primaries.  Instead, somehow finds some random vampire party and becomes their candidate's biggest champion.

*Andy - Tries to vote for Bernie, somehow breaks the voting machine.

*Ann - Tells Leslie she's voting for Hillary, but is really a Bernie supporter and would never reveal it to Leslie for fear of the consequences that come from her from not voting for a woman.

*Donna - Trump - He promised he'd lower taxes.

*Jerry - Tries to vote for Hillary, somehow ends up voting for Trump.

*Chris - Thinks that all candidates bring positive energy to our system, breaks the machine when he tries to vote for all of them.

Later on in the season she talks about running for Dexhart's district, but needing to live there first (for 51% of the time). If she got voted out of office, are we to assume (given she was replaced by an Eagleton representative) that the district she vacated went unrepresented?

Can we talk about Ben and Leslie's break up?,"In the premiere of Season 4, Ben reveals to Leslie that he knows about her city council campaign, by presenting her with a ""KNOPE 2012"" badge. 

This has to be one of the most gut wrenching break up scenes that I've ever seen on television. The lack of music (due to it being a mockumentary) just makes everything feel so real. The emotion in each of the characters as they experience what has to be one of the most bittersweet moments of their lives just hits so hard. 

The audience can easily feel the support and love that Ben has for Leslie, something that I didn't think would be able to be captured for this character. When Leslie first started seeing Ben as a potential love interest, I was extremely skeptical. I kept thinking to myself that the thing that made Leslie's character work was that she was independent and the story focused more on her career than her love life. But the writers pulled it off. They brought in a character who truly understood this other character and deserved her. 

In most television shows, break ups usually suck to watch, but aren't too terrible because you automatically know they'll get back together; it's the classic Ross &amp; Rachel scenario. This felt different though. Watching these two break up had a sense of permanence to it. It was a true mark of sacrifice and emotion. 

Like I said, Ben and Leslie felt like a bad cliche idea when I first experienced the show, but now I see their relationship as one of the best and most well-paced romances on television.

About Parks and Rec and the job search,"An Open Statement about Parks and Recreation:

If you ever find yourself in the situation that I am now, currently seeking new employment in your mid-20s, and you need to have something going on in the background to keep the countless resumes and cover letters from driving you mad, pop on Parks and Rec. 
When you are looking for your dream job and coming up with nothing but place holders and compromises, it’s so inspiring to look at almost any character on the show. Take Ron, working since pre-adolescence he has found a career that lets him pursue his side-hustles of wood working and investing while still getting to milk the government for wages for doing basically nothing. Look at Leslie, who chose to be so committed to something that she eventually cared too much and had to keep moving higher and higher. Look at April who was killing time until she decided to make up her own position, take charge of a department and still remind Andy that no one really knows what they’re doing. Ben bounces around from job so quick that accepting a job is basically second nature to him. Even Andy, loveable goofball Andy, is able to accidentally become great at something and have fun at work doing something creative that he loves. Donna keeps her office job in a small town so that she can pay off her condo in Seattle and live the luxury life she wants to. And last but not least Tom, the small town mogul who will throw his last penny into his dreams, after years of struggle he makes it work.
 I know this is a television show, that it’s not always realistic or true, but when you’re staring dead eyed at another description of some 9-5 that may or may not be your dream you can always look to these fantastic characters to see how it can all be better if you let it. And hey! At least you’re not Jerry!
... Just kidding, Jerry had a very fulfilling life too.

Favorite moment from the first two seasons?,"Most would probably agree that seasons 1 and 2 had a relatively different feel to them than seasons 3-7. After all, two of the main (and very likable) characters hadn't arrived yet and the show was still finding itself and trying not to turn into another Office remake, which it ultimately succeeded at, again, in seasons 3-7.  

It took me a while to get into this show. Hell, I almost didn't make it through Season 1, which only has six episodes. However, going back and re-watching, I've discovered that the early episodes actually have some pretty great moments. 

Personal Example: 

Anne: (Looking at a picture of Dave [Louis C.K.] Aww, that's a great photo. 

Leslie: Thanks. I asked the police if I could have it and they said 'no' so I stole it.

Dear Parks and Recreation,"Dear Parks and Recreation seven seasons one hundred and twenty five episodes later its been about two weeks since I started this journey and now 15 minutes after finishing the finale I sit here in tears and many other emotions. In these short two weeks this show has thought me more about true friendship love life and service then I have learned my life so far. To many this was nothing more then a comedy TV show but to me it feels like so much more. You see when you consume a TV show like this one with so much emotion and true personality in such a short period of time you feel as if these characters are almost your friends and your watching a chapter in ones life. The truly amazing characters from my personal favorites of Ron Swanson and Ben Wyatt to the amazingly talented April Ludgate. These people even if only fictional characters where something more after these short two weeks the feel as if they were life long friends and as the series now ends it feels as if I've opened a new chapter in my life and much like Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope I sit her wanting to be with these friends all in one room and feel sorrow and sadness at the thought of loosing these great ""work proximity acquaintance"". These people each teaching me something new which honestly are virtues I strive everyday to carry on in my real life now. Ron Swanson the silent yet caring man with strong manly virtues has brought me to come to his way which I use everyday and I have even started wood working. Leslie Knope has shown me the ways of civil service and has helped me realize what it truly is to help the people and community you believe in and love. This has brought me a new found respect for my tiny Midwestern town much like Pawnee Indiana [spoiler] (#s ""pre expansion of course.""). Benjamin Wyatt a subtle nerd much like me and a lover of accounting and finance. Also and driven public servant winning mayor ship of his town at 18. Ben has driven me to looking to running for public office in my local town now. Andy Dwyer has thought me so much about how sometimes its ok to let it loose and have fun and to be kind to everyone and sometimes you can role-play a crazy dream job much like the amazing Burt Macklin. It these small things that Andy has thought me that I strive to remember each and every day. April Ludgate a quite publicly world hating girl but truly on the inside loves helping the world improve she has thought me much in ways I simple cannot put into to words but I believe we all feel. Gary Gergich even though many people hated him much like Ben I felt Gary was one of the best people I have ever fictionally had the honor of meeting/watching and learning his values.

"Just finished the Series for the first time, here are my thoughts. [Mild Spoilers]","I'm going to compare this to The Office, because I have watched that over and over.  
I feel like the humor in P and R is much more forced than in The Office, and that can also be attributed to the characters. The Office has so many different types of people, including normal people, where in PR, everyone is weird in some sort of way. No one is there to balance out the crazies.  

The Finale just seemed off, actually, the whole last season. I just feel like going into the future and skipping three years wasn't the best choice in my opinion. The Finale was just where they had one episode to make everything good, but the entire show is about things going wrong. Also, the Gryzzl technology and all of the future stuff just seems off, I can't place it, but that kind of lessened the experience of the Finale.  

I like the show, but it seemed like I was just watching it to see how they end up. And again, this is all just my opinion.

I put on an episode from season 4 and found myself able to refocus and relax. Its such a positive show. There's so much light and love and happiness in just about every single episode, its impossible to remain sad.

I know it's not meant to be thought of to a serious extent, but it's just a little weird is all.

Starring: Jean Ralphio and Mona Lisa Saperstein

With: Barney Varmn, Dennis Feinstein, Perd Hapley, Carl Lorthner, Kyle, Oren

The siblings have started a champagne flavoured gelato business and have hired Barney Varmn as their accountant. Dennis Feinstein is the villain, becoming the #1 Perfumist only made his appetite for power more ravenous, his sights are now set on World Domination. Kyle and Oren developed a perfume so good that it makes people fall in love. Dennis found out and locked them in the guesthouse of his mansion so he can steal their recipe and get credit for it. Oren and Kyle are so apathetic that they don't try to escape but Perd finds out using his psychic powers and tries to free them in order to report the case. He hires Carl Lorthner to investigate but his really loud voice consistently ruins everything. Here's a glimpse:

Carl: KYLE... OREN... ARE YOU IN THERE? HEY GUYS HOW'S IT GOIN'?

Kyle: Oh, hey Carl. Yeah, it's okay. It'd be nice if he gave us water though.

Oren:

Perd [through walkie talkie]: Carl, have you, as the old expression goes, ""cracked the case"" ?

Carl: JUST A MINUTE PERD I- OH. DENNIS FEINSTEIN'S MUTANT LAVENDER PLANT GUARDS FOUND ME SOMEHOW, TIED ME TO THE PERFUME SILO.

Perd: Well, it seems we'll have to wait until next time on ""Renaissance Love"".

Kyle: Hey, um, do you think you could get a doctor over here? One of Feinstein's Ocelots gnawed my leg off. It should be okay, just wondering...

I love the way P&amp;R introduces new things in the show earlier than usual,"Bit of a shitty title, but it's hard to summarize. Basically, Parks and Rec does something I haven't seen in other shows - rather than introduce a new character/relationship/idea/whatever at the start of an episode or the start of a season, it will introduce it towards the end of the previous episode or season. Not quite the same as foreshadowing, where something is hinted at, but more like introducing something and just leaving it unexplained until later.

Example #1: The character of Dennis Feinstein is mentioned in Season 2 Episode 16 (and again in Season 2 Episode 21). The character doesn't actually appear until Season 3 Episode 6.

Example #2: Ben and Chris first appear in Season 2 Episode 23, and then play a major role in Season 3 onwards. Traditionally, new characters would be introduced at the start of the season.

Example #3: Orin is first mentioned in Season 3 Episode 3, but doesn't appear until Season 3 Episode 9.

* Jerry Farts, better have the entire cast make fun of him for the rest of the scene, beat the joke the death. This is not just a 1 time thing, this is a running gag thats not funny and completely over done. It just feels like every 4 episodes has a Jerry fart joke moment.

just finished seasons 1-7. quick Question...,"Without going through every episode's wiki/IMDB/etc, is anyone aware of a major writer's switch or show direction between seasons 5 and 6? 

The first 5 seasons were unbelievably funny, enjoyable and memorable. Without question one of my 5 favorite shows of all time. Then, in the blink of an eye, season six begins and there is a catastrophic switch in the show's jokes, set-ups, and characters. Every single joke became cringe-worthy, the set ups were horrid, Andy went from a hysterical clutz - to a mentally challenged 5 year old, Ron's character traits switched depending on every scene in every specific episode, Leslie went from funny/quirky to a 85% serious/15% Aspberger's sufferer. Tom lost 75% of his enthusiasm, Ben was shoved into the lead supporting actor's position when his character never has the depth to make that interesting. It just seemed like none of the characters grew, rather they just magnified each of their traits at all the wrong possible times. 

I'm assuming something changed within the show's production or staff due to the fact that every single one of this issues began in episode 1 and 2 of season 6. Not really sure what type of answers im expecting here, just wanted to know if you all felt the same.

I have *not* stopped thinking about that, which really brings up the question of why someone as talented as Johnathan Joss has never been approached to star in his own show.

Ken Hotate was arguably the most underutilized secondary character throughout all of Parks and Rec.  Joss *slayed* in every single scene he was in.  That on top of his years as John Redcorn, you would think that his potential in a leading role would have been noticed by someone.

Not to mention, how badass would it be to have a native American-led comedy on national TV?  I'm pretty sure that's never happened before, and it has potential to be fucking amazing.

I would have loved a Pokemon Go themed episode,"A quick synopsis of each of the character's plot lines, along with their corresponding Pokemon (similar to the Spirit Animal episode, solely going by the 151 originals):

Leslie: Becomes all giddy with excitement as townspeople flock to the parks moreso than ever, and fully supports the game. However, the idiotic townspeople raise hell in their public forums, calling for an outlaw of the game as the Pokemon ""poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"" Her Pokemon is Nidoqueen because she is a ""strong, empowered woman.""

Ben: Becomes completely enamored with the game, causing a stir among the townspeople that he is supporting the evil which comes back to Leslie. His Pokemon is Porygon because ""he's a nerd."" Ben mutters under his breath that Mewtwo is smarter.

Tom: Buys dozens of lures to try to attract and meet women. Fails miserably. His Pokemon is Meowth, due to his love of ""tangible items, and getting involved in hijinks that always ends in failure.""

Ron: Doesn't play the game, and struggles to correctly pronounce ""Pocket Men."" April assigns him Arcanine. Ron nods.

Ann Perkins: Is dating a guy at the time so she gets completely wrapped up in the game, complete with as much gear as one cares to talk about. Her Pokemon is Ditto, since she takes on the form of whomever she is with. Ann is offended, but Leslie says she is Ninetales, because she is a beautiful, ethnic, elegant fox.

Chris: Is leaps and bounds better than everyone at the game. Hatches many eggs a day on his ""morning, noon, evening, and night time 15 K runs!"" His Pokemon is Machoke. Chris cries and tells April it is ""litrally the best comparison I've ever received.""

Andy: Tries to teach April the ins and outs of the game, but she is extremely apathetic.Andy continues to play and succeeds. April tries to assign him a Pokemon, but before she can, Andy interrupts and exclaims that he is Scyther. We then go off to an aside, where Andy said ""Who wouldn't want to be Scyther! He has swords for hands! Nobody messes with Scyther."" Ben then comes around the corner and explains that praying mantises decapitate their partner after mating, causing Andy to reconsider. He never does.

April: As stated, doesn't become involved with the game, because ""everyone is doing it and I don't want to be part of the hivemind."" Secretly loves Pokemon, causing her to assign a spirit Pokemon to everyone. Assigns herself Gengar, because she would love to ""hypnotize people and eat their dreams while they sleep.""

Jerry: Joins Team Instinct. April assigns him Bulbasaur, because of the three starters Bulbasaur is the one people least care about. Jerry says it reminds him of Gayle's gardens.

Donna: Doesn't play the game, but has all of her boyfriends succeed in it for her. April assigns her Persian, because she is an elegant and beautiful Pokemon.

Recurring characters:

Animal control - go to parks to play the game on AR, try to use actual tools of theirs to catch Pokemon. ""There's a couple of Psyducks,"" mutters April.

Councilman Jamm - Somehow cheats in the game, and gets under Leslie's skin when it comes to the townspeople. April pulls Leslie aside and refers to him as Magikarp, since he keeps flopping around but never actually does any damage.

I just finished watching the show for the first time in my life. One hell of a ride.,"I just watched the series finale, and yes, manly tears were shed, but not for long. I have watched Greg Daniels' previous work in The Office (US version) and fell in love with the show. It had an amazing  cast, with a great romance and the finale sent me into emotional trauma. However, I didn't feel the ""need"" to cry in this finale.

I love this show, don't get it wrong, and I adore the show in its entirety. The second I saw the cast, I thought to myself: ""Huh, this show can be great"". And by god, it was. Tommy Timberlake is obviously the best character (with Ron coming in a very close 2nd), and the comedy was superb. I feel like the emotional side of the show wasn't really the main part (as it sort of was in The Office, along with the excellent comedy), and that Greg Daniels and the rest of the crew seemed to focus more on the excellent, amazing jokes. Seeing Jerry/Garry/Terry/Larry/Barry fail time after time in his daily life, seeing Ron dislike everything that has to do with anyone, seeing Tom's and Donna's amazing on-screen chemistry blossom and see the show in its entirety with all the inside jokes (I really need to get myself a copy of Cones of Dunshire), really improved my life.

I've seen many excellent comedy shows, such as Seinfeld, The Office, How I Met Your Mother and many more, but this show was something else. The excellent blend of comedy, emotion and chemistry between the actors was incredible, and it was truly, one hell of a ride.

What are your favorite episodes from each season? Pick one or two from each season that you think are the best, most well done episodes from each season, 1-7. Additionally, name your favorite overall episode. 

My picks:

S1: Canvassing - season 1 is pretty rough, but this episode was one of the most tolerable. This is back when Leslie was the female Michael Scott, and the opening scene with Tom forgetting to hide the Easter eggs is gold.
S2: Practice Date - a classic, Leslie's first date with Dave was hilarious. Also arguably the best subplot of any episode with the office game of uncovering dirt.
and Ron and Tammy - no explanation needed. This one contains some of the best one liners in the shows history
S3: Flu Season - the April-Ann feud at its finest, and I loved Ron and Andy's bonding. Also, Chris's hypochondria is icing on the cake. 
and Andy and April's Fancy Party - this was the most impulsive and cheesy TV wedding of all time, and it completely worked. This episode perfectly encapsulates their relationship.
S4: Pawnee Rangers - The Ron and Leslie dynamic has always been great, but this was an all time high. Watching the struggle for power over trivial competitions always results in a funny episode.
S5: Leslie and Ben - I hate Jamm. So much. Alongside what may have been one of the greatest TV weddings ever, watching Ron punch him in the face was definitely in my top 3 favorite moments of the show.
S6: Moving Up - This could've been the finale in itself (though I'm happy it wasn't). One of the most well done retrospective episodes the show has done, though it pretty much invalidated the whole mockumentary setup.
And Ann and Chris - one of the best send-off episodes I've ever seen. They did t over do it with flashbacks of the show's earlier days, and it was a perfect mix of bittersweet and lighthearted.
S7: Leslie and Ron - I've always loved episodes centered around these two, but this was by far the best. P&amp;R has always been good at being emotional and hilarious. This episode exemplifies both at the same time.

My overactive imagination created an episode featuring Swanson while sleeping the other night.,"""Fools Gold"" 

I had a dream the other night where Ron Swanson was kidnapped by robbers and taken back to his cabin in the woods, demanding to know where his gold was.

On camera after the events, Ron giggling, ""I knew this day would come. However, I've been planning this for years. You see, I've setup this elaborate puzzle so that every time someone finds a piece, it's actually just a trigger mechanism to text my friends from Pawnee. It reads, ""I have been kidnapped. Do not be alarmed. Send law enforcement officers to the following address.""

You see after they've figured out the puzzle, it sends them to a room that in fact does contain some of my gold. The only problem is, when they lift it off the pedestal, they're locked in, making it quite easy for our men in blue to take them off to prison.""

I'm pretty sure the ringleader of the group is Mona-Lisa Saperstein who often during the episode will proclaim, ""Come on can we just kill him already cuz we're totally badass robbers and stuff."" Jean-Ralphio would also be one of the robbers.

There would be a scene with Tom saying to himself, ""Don't be the Sapersteins, don't be the Sapersteins. *Perd on the tv"" Insiders suggest the kidnappers are in fact Mona-Lisa and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, children of local Pawnee investor Dr. Saperstein."" Oh come on! Seriously guys? Totally not cool."" Donna, lowering her glasses at Tom, ""I told you those two were trouble.""

Andy would make the arrest as Burt Macklin. Leslie would be super impatient and have to be held back by Ben the whole episode. April would show a surprising but heartfelt show of emotion and actually be worried about Ron, only at the end of the episode to be like, ""Whatever, I would have just killed them with my mind powers."" as she stares intensely at Mona-Lisa as they push her into the cop car. 

And of course Jerry would somehow have been dragged into the kidnappers group and be left inside the room at the episode, ""Guys. Guys? Come on guys I'm going to be late for pizza night!""",PandR,1432716568,dresdenreader,2,7,True,,False,,2015-05-27

Where can I find/make Ben &amp; Leslie's engagement ring box?,"My girlfriend loves Parks and Rec, and when I propose to her in about six weeks I'd like to use the same box that [Ben used when he proposed to Leslie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujymb4d388A).

I'm pretty sure the box is about 7x7x2, and I can find a cherry wood gift box on Amazon like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Large-Cherry-Wood-Necklace-Jewelry/dp/B0037MTGNA) or [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Cherry-Wood-Large-Necklace-Jewelry/dp/B00JWUO2WG).

I'm proposing immediately after we close on our new house, once we get back to the empty house. Since it's similar to how that scene happened, I'd like the box to be as accurate as possible.

A question about the pilot,"Like a lot of Reddit posts, there is a very real chance this question has already been answered or addressed. However, I will ask it anyway. In the pilot, Mark Brendanawicz asks Ron to sign off on Leslie's plans for lot 48. By doing so, he says that Ron ""owes him one"". As Mark was only present for 20-some episodes, there isn't much insight to his character except being the mind-numbingly boring voice of reason so we never really get an answer as to why he owed him. My only standing theory is his knowledge of Duke Silver, as he is the one who nudged Tom in his direction.

What is the general consensus on Season 7 and the series finale on here? Because I felt both were quite weak.,"Maybe it's because I don't really watch network TV (P&amp;R is the first network sitcom I have watched since The Office ended) and instead watch cable where shows typically are darker.

I get that P&amp;R was a really cheerful and positive show. But everyone's lives literally ended exactly how they wanted, absolutely perfectly.

I thought that maybe they were switching gears with having Tom's Bistro fail, but of course he just turns all of his business failures into a best-selling book and he becomes famous after all. 

They had already turned April into Leslie 2, but then of course she just decides to go from staunchly anti-child to having 2 kids (and we still don't learn what happened to Andy)

And of course everyone knew that Leslie would be president by the end.

I mean it just seems like P&amp;R had turned from a great overall show in it's first 4-5 seasons or so that anyone could enjoy, to the type of show in Season 6 and 7 that mainly caters to suburban middle aged mothers who want a sweet family show to watch with her kids before bed. Hell, at least some of the earlier episodes were TV-14. The final 3 seasons were all TV-PG

But every single person who was parks director hated their job, and hated everyone they worked with. [Then a long pause] Are we going to hate each other some day?"" One scene later and Leslie states, ""Why do people eat anything other than breakfast food? Because people are idiots Leslie.""

If that's not foreshadowing, then I don't know what is. (If you are unaware to what I'm referencing, in the final season of the show, there is a ""mysterious"" feud between Leslie and Ron. Ultimately it ends up with them making up, and walking out the door saying a famous quote, but in the opposite context. ""Why do people eat anything other than breakfast food? Because people are Idiots Ron."" A quote that was said in, you guessed it, JJ's Diner).

"Let's point out all the little ""self reference"" moments we know!","I'm sorry I couldn't find a better title for this, because this is not always considered ""meta humor"" in my opinion. But Parks and Rec has a lot of moments where a joke or a small nod pays off much later in either the series or the episode, and it usually takes multiple views of the series or the episode to figure it out.

A few examples:

* The date that Ann set up Leslie with to keep her away from Justin on season 2's ""The Set Up"" pointed out that Leslie could have triplets ""right off the bat"" when he peformed an MRI on her.
* April buys Andy a Reggie Wayne jersey in ""Christmas Scandal"", which he later wears for their wedding. This one may be a bit blunt and obvious, but as a guy who doesn't have any football airing in his country, it took me a rerun or two to notice that, before Andy actually pointed that out when he met Reggie Wayne later in the series.
* In ""End of the World"", Leslie mentions that Ben and her are in good company with other pairs of people who never hang out, one of the examples being G/L/T/B/Jerry and April. A bit later in the episode, Jerry and April hang out along with Andy and Natalie to help Andy check stuff off of his bucket list by filming an action scene featuring Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole.

Predictions for Season 7 [spoilers],"There was a lot to take in with the season finale. We know that Season 7 will begin with a time jump to 2017, and that much of the show will revolve around Leslie's regional NPS office. We do not know much else about where all the characters will be in three years.  So, here is my character by character predictions:

**Leslie:** Let's start with an easy one. We know she is a regional director of the NPS and a new(ish) mom. Both of these will provide plenty of possible story lines, but Leslie isn't Leslie unless she is working on a big project. So, after 3 years of coordinating several initiatives around the Midwest, she sets her sights on a project closer to home. Leslie is working on turning a swath of forests into the country's first National Forest in 35 years, the Wamapoke National Forest. (The 1st thing she says after the time jump is ""Call Ken and Rebecca, we are on a media lockdown.."" is she referring to Ken Hotate?)

**Ben:**  We know that Ben is working for the City in some fashion (they mention his office downstairs). This upcoming season, Ben faces his biggest failure when he becomes the Mayor of Pawnee.  This would explain why it's his big night (it's his inauguration) and it would make Leslie the First Lady of Pawnee.

**Tom:** During the time jump, Tom went from the owner of a promising restaurant to a mini mogul.  He owns Tom's Bistro, part of the Snakehole Lounge, Rent-a-Swag (it's back!) and several other ventures.  He no longer works at City Hall (sad face), but now that he is higher up on the food chain, other people are running the day-to-day operations of his businesses, leaving Tom with plenty of time to hang out with his friends from the parks dept.  

**Ron:** Ron moves up to the 3rd floor with Leslie. He doesn't like change (or taking orders from leslie) but he did say that the NPS is the only branch of the government worth a damn.  When Leslie offered Ron the position of Chief Park Ranger the job was too good to pass up.

**~~Gary Jerry Larry~~ Terry:** Leslie begrudgingly brought Terry to the NPS office.  A few episodes in, a giant blunder caused by Terry gets him fired.  He is given his old job back at Pawnee Parks and Rec, but is soon terminated again.  He spends the rest of the series as the Pawnee City Hall shoe shine.   

**April:** When Leslie and Ron both leave the Parks and Rec Dept, they agree that they want April to be the new Director.  April has shown both apathy towards government in front of Ron and passion for certain projects in front of Leslie.  They both think that they are leaving the Department with someone that shares their values.  Instead, the department goes in a weird and awesome direction.

**Andy:** During the time jump Andy becomes the next Raffi and makes a ton of money off of his children's albums. When a reunited Land Ho covers ""The Pit"" and it becomes a modest hit, Andy is inspired to give rock another shot.  The former members of Mouse Rat are busy with careers and families, so Andy decides to pay them a salary to quit their jobs and devote their time to making Mouse Rat a real band.  Andy spends the season making music, watching the triplets, and goofing off.  At the end of the series, Mouse Rat is given the opportunity to go on a national tour.

**Donna:** It is never revealed how Donna affords her lavish lifestyle and multiple homes. She is offered a job from Leslie, but declines. Donna, who doesn't need the money and doesn't care about title, decides that it would be easier and more fun to take Leslie's old office and help April run Pawnee Parks and Rec.

**Craig:** Craig, who ""DID EVERYTHING!"" in Eagleton's Parks Dept, remains in the Pawnee Parks Dept with April and Donna.

**Lot 48:** Without Leslie in Pawnee's government Lot 48 has several delays.  Ben and Leslie pull some strings to finally get the project completed and Pawnee Commons opens for the series finale.

**New Characters:** Ann and Chris were never replaced following their departure.  This would allow the addition of 2 or three minor characters to be added to fill in both the Parks Dept and the NPS Dept. ",PandR,1398790728,Yellowcrown,10,55,True,,False,,2014-04-29

Jerry isn't as unlucky as we would love to think. (Math and bad grammar inside.),"Aside from have the best home life out of all of the parks and rec characters, he doesn't have as many unlucky moments we are led to believe. In season 5 episode 9, ""Ron and Diane"" they are going to jerry dinner and they had put a dollar in a box for every time jerry had done something funny. 


The total amount of money they had was 518 dollars. Assuming they are at work 5 days out of the week that is approx. 260 days at work a year. (52 weeks x 5 days a week, before holidays.) 


Now we know there were 4 people going to Jerry dinner. (Donna, April, Andy, Tom ) that being said we can assume more than one dollar was being out I. The donation box for each embarrassing thing jerry did. Even if one dollar was donated per goof were sitting at only about 2 screw ups per day. (518/260 =1.99) We can assume that number being less than that however because if all of them were present, they would all donate a dollar. 


TL;DR: jerry screws up a lot less then we think he really does.

Ron Swanson Spinoff,I am sure someone has posted this already but I am going to post it anyway. I would love a Ron Swanson show.

He could have his wife and kids on the show and how he deals with them in his Ron Swanson way. He could have wacky helpers at his wood shop who he puts up with because they remind him of april and leslie. Guest stars could come on and order things from his woodshop.

As our final season approaches...,"With the final season approaching, I thought it would be especially appropriate for this subreddit to show solidarity in reflecting on the show that's given us so much these past 5 years. I'm posting this thread to see what you guys would think about a weekly rewatch and discussion, starting with Season 1, and ending with Season 6, just in time for the premiere of the final season.


**Why would I want to do this?**
There's a lot of time between now and the season premiere ([which sources say will probably be in January of 2015](http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/05/21/parks-and-recreation-season-7-final-michael-schur/)). I know I'm going to get antsy, and the best cure for my angst has always been reliving the past and talking about it with others.

**Okay... but what else?**
Besides the weekly discussions, I'm personally willing to put in time linking to past recaps/reviews, extra scenes and special features, and other fun things relevant to the episodes of the week. You'd be surprised how much is out there.

**So how would it work?**
I'll make a (rough) schedule for each week of which episodes we should plan on watching. Once a week, a new discussion thread will be stickied, where we'll get to talk about our favorite moments and character development, link to all our favorite gifs, check out other goodies, etc.

By my count, there are 112 episodes to get through, and about 32 weeks (probably more) until [when I expect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-season_replacement) the Season 7 premiere will air. That averages to about 3.5 eps a week. Of course the specifics are something we could all decide. (I was actually thinking about having all of Season 1 in a week)


So what do you think guys? I think this is a great chance to keep our community alive and show support for the show to anyone who happens to be watching.

Every week, on **Tuesday** and **Friday**, discussion threads will be posted and pinned. The pace will likely be **two episodes per discussion thread**, which comes out to 4 episodes per week.

**The first week is special:** I'll be posting a discussion thread for Season 1 as a whole this Tuesday, and then we'll move on to Season 2 the next Tuesday, with the regular 2 eps/discussion pace.

Does anyone else really dislike Ann Perkins?,"Sorry if this has been said before (new to this sub) but Ann's character just consistently pisses me off. Every other character, however annoying, has redeeming features and can be empathised with. That's one of the main reasons I love the show; pretty much everyone is lovable in their own way. But Ann? She treats Chris like shit, Mark like shit, refuses to get over Chris and then bangs everyone in sight. She's mean spirited and not a good friend to Leslie.

[SPOILER] Re-watched the Season 6 finale and I think there is more to a certain character than most people realized [SPOILER],"All of us that have already watched the Season 6 finale knows that the final scene jumps ahead 3 years.  Leslie is rushing around the 3rd flood of the Parks Department and we are introduced to a character that is even more incompetent than Jerry/Gary/Larry/Terry.  We are introduced to Ed, a character played by Jon Hamm.  

He walks into the already bustling room and when asked where the file is he replies with a smile, ""I'm sorry Ms. Knope, I've lost the file, it's gone.""  

This prompts Leslie to fire him, and he then says, again with a smile, ""I understand, thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.  Goodbye everyone!  It's been a great three years!""

His stress-free, seemingly always happy disposition, as well as the cadence and tone of his speech, leads me to believe that he is in some way related to Chris Traeger.  I can picture an incompetent Chris answer the same questions in the exact same way.  Think about when Chris would try to spin something that was terrible into something positive.  He always said it so upbeat, and would never lie about a situation, exactly like how Ed says it.

Observations by a new Parks and Rec fan,"I started watching Parks and Rec 2 weeks ago.  I've been gorging via Netflix and I'm almost done with season 4. Some thoughts &amp; observations...

* Ron Swanson is not funny.  I've laughed ""on the inside"" a few times at some things he's said, but he's just not funny.  I know I'm in the minority here, but I've tried and he's just not.  I'm sure this statement will be what sends me into downvote hell.  I'm a big fan of deadpan humor.  But he forgot the humor part of his deadpan humor.  I get it: He likes meat &amp; his mustache, and hates government &amp; his ex-wives.  I think my expectations were just too high based on what I'd heard about the character.  I've seen Nick Offerman on Conan or some late night show, and he's pretty damn funny.  I will say the Duke Silver storyline is really really funny.

* Chris Traeger is just annoying.  Rob Lowe seems to think his ""Litrally"" &amp; ""Ann Perkins"" catch phrases are ""up there with 'Whatchu talkin 'bout Willis?'"" (Source: http://www.vulture.com/2012/09/rob-lowe-literally-parks-and-recreation.html)   But I just find him to be a lame tryhard. 

* Andy is hilarious.  I'm surprised I didn't hear more about him from my friends who watch the show.  I love how he's so comfortable with who he is (rollerblading, DMB playing, ""bro"") and being such a goof.  I also love his and relationship with April.

* Aziz kills. 

* I love how positive the show is.  Other than Jerry, the show is not really centered on negativity or ripping on people.  Don't get me wrong, that definitely has it's place and is quite funny, but the positivity of Parks and Rec is refreshing.

* I've heard P&amp;R was recently renewed for a 6th season.  Is there any  word on how long the writers/producers/Amy Poehler/whoever have in mind for the show?",PandR,1368784855,[deleted],0,0,True,,False,,2013-05-17

I know I'm super late on this but jesus christ this show is awesome. In one day I've burned through three seasons. I love Andy, Jerry, Ron, everyone just works together so well. It's the little things that stick. Like when Leslie throws Jerry's painting into the lake when they all began getting together again.

DAE think that Bobby Newport should gain a permanent membership in the Pawnee Parks and Rec department?,"I've only watched him in one episode (I've honestly only seen about 2 seasons worth of the show, need to start a dedicated following now that I have free time), but I think he'd fit right in and add an interesting dynamic to an already brillinat cast.  Even if they could only get Rudd to sign on for one full season, I think it'd be magical.  I already like the dynamic between Chris and Ron, and it'd be fun to see him and Leslie both lose out on the election to some come from behind candidate and be forced to somehow work with each other (Bobby actually decides to get a job).  He'd be care-free and piss off Leslie and probably Ron.  I could see him getting along with Tom and Chris.  It'd be a lot of fun I think; he could hit on Anne all the time and try to like pay her for sex or something haha (that's why I'm not a writer).  I could see him being good friends and a third wheel in Andy and April's relationship (they'd find him youthful and fun I'd imagine).  

Thoughts?  Would having a big star ruin Parks and Recs and cause too much focus on Bobby?  I think they've down well with big stars like Rob Lowe and Amy Poehler.

What does everyone think of this season?,"Now, I don't mean to diss the show.  I LOVE Parks and Rec and I still think it's a great.  However, this season seems to be dragging a bit to me.  The plots are very repetitive (something in the campaign goes wrong, all is well by the end), Tom is getting more annoying (the relationship with Anne just seems unnecessary), Ron is becoming even more of a caricature and sort of stale (I still don't get why he's a fan favorite--I love most of the characters for various reasons but aside from his relationship with Leslie, he's always been a bit one-note).  I feel like everyone is too familiar and understood by this point; there needs to be a shake up and more growth so the character interactions don't feel so ""safe"".

I'm definitely excited to see what happens next--will Leslie win?  How will she handle the new job and still have time for the Parks department?  What will Ron be doing?  If Leslie loses, will she bounce back?  How?  What will the others be up to, in either case?  There are certainly a lot of directions they could take--I just hope we don't get more, ""Leslie has bad PR, but it's fixed and she is more or less supported by the end"" plots if she ends up winning.

Besides being a repeat part, I felt that her character was too dominating on the screen in Parks and Rec because it detracted from the main characters (Ben, Leslie) being able to do what people love them for.

And we're done! What are some of your favourite moments/scenes/jokes from season 3?,"Here are my five favourite scenes:

-The stinger in ""Media Blitz,"" where Leslie and Tom applaud Ben's meltdown while he takes a bow

-Natalie's wedding speech in ""Fancy Party"" and April's reaction to it

-Leslie and Ann's argument shot from outside a bar bathroom in ""The Fight""

-The cold open to ""The Bubble,"" where Ann's office is full of balloons

-The wide shots of all of Pawnee present at the memorial service in ""Li'l Sebastian""


And it wasn't the best gag, but for some reason the biggest laugh of the season for me was the way Perd Hapley introduced Ya Herd: ""Today's show begins... now.""

Just one of the nicest things I've ever heard, just a small part of why I love this show. I felt the same way about the early seasons of the Office. It's not just that they're funny, they obviously are, but they create this really happy atmosphere and I always just feel good watching these shows.

Rashida Jones' 'new' role in the show,"It seems like they are giving Ann a lot more comedic lines and 'forcing' her to have more on-screen time with the rest of the cast (whereas she was with Leslie most of the time).

I think this is working out fantastically! Ann was always the 'outsider' that didn't feel (to me) like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast.

In season 4 this has drastically changed. I loved her bit with April and Ron where she set out to have a casual and **amicable** small talk with them.

Thoughts on reclaiming /r/ParksandRecreation?,"It's sitting there without a mod... [This is the process for reclaiming it](http://www.reddit.com/help/moderation#Idliketomoderateaninactivereddit.WhodoIcontact):

&gt; Head over to [RedditRequest](/r/RedditRequest) and make a post asking to take over moderating duties. If you haven't heard anything in three days, send a PM with the name of the reddit to [Erik](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hueypriest&amp;subject=Taking+over+an+abandoned+reddit%3F), the community manager.

For it? Against it? Share your thoughts.

My reasoning for doing this is that it's way easier for some random person to think of /r/ParksandRecreation as the probable title of a ""Parks and Recreation""-based subreddit, rather than somehow discovering this one. While, obviously, we're all already here, we could either attempt to move there, or at least have one person modded there to edit the sidebar to say ""/r/PandR is the main Parks and Recreation subreddit."" or something.

S03E04 Discussion,"This ep was really funny and it was great to see Tammy back. I love how she went ape-shit and started attacking Tom. Epic lols. 

I do miss Mark Brendanawicz though, I get the sense most people see him as a bit of a ""meh"" character but I really liked his character. Could've done with more April + Andy storyline but then I don't want it resolved quickly so its good to put it on the backburner for a while (AH! CONFLICTING VIEWS!)

The show really has found its grove, I just hope that it doesn't get canceled like every other decent show on television.

I think it was beyond epic. Though, I'm a bit concerned about changes to characters' personalities but I guess as others have said to me, it is a natural progression. E.g. April - it stands to reason she'd be happier now than in the past.
